# Use cases [introduction]
$$$what-is-kib$$$
$$$what-is-es$$$

The {{stack}} is used for a wide and growing range of use cases. Here are a few examples:

## Elasticsearch

- **Full-text search**: Build a fast, relevant full-text search solution using inverted indexes, tokenization, and text analysis.
- **Vector database**: Store and search vectorized data, and create vector embeddings with built-in and third-party natural language processing (NLP) models.
- **Semantic search**: Understand the intent and contextual meaning behind search queries using tools like synonyms, dense vector embeddings, and learned sparse query-document expansion.
- **Hybrid search**: Combine full-text search with vector search using state-of-the-art ranking algorithms.
- **Build search experiences**: Add hybrid search capabilities to apps or websites, or build enterprise search engines over your organization’s internal data sources.
- **Retrieval augmented generation (RAG)**: Use {{ecloud}} as a retrieval engine to supplement generative AI models with more relevant, up-to-date, or proprietary data for a range of use cases.
- **Geospatial search**: Search for locations and calculate spatial relationships using geospatial queries.

## Observability

- **Logs, metrics, and traces**: Collect, store, and analyze logs, metrics, and traces from applications, systems, and services.
- **Application performance monitoring (APM)**: Monitor and analyze the performance of business-critical software applications.
- **Real user monitoring (RUM)**: Monitor, quantify, and analyze user interactions with web applications.
- **OpenTelemetry**: Reuse your existing instrumentation to send telemetry data to the Elastic Stack using the OpenTelemetry standard.

## Security

- **Security information and event management (SIEM)**: Collect, store, and analyze security data from applications, systems, and services.
- **Endpoint security**: Monitor and analyze endpoint security data.
- **Threat hunting**: Search and analyze data to detect and respond to security threats.

This is just a sample of search, observability, and security use cases enabled by {{ecloud}}. Refer to Elastic [customer success stories](https://www.elastic.co/customers/success-stories) for concrete examples across a range of industries.
