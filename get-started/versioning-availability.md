# Understanding versioning and availability

On this page, you'll learn about our versioning systems, how to understand how we talk about versions and feature availability in our documentation, and where to find docs for your product version.

## Elastic Stack versioning

{{es}} and the core components of the Elastic Stack use a semantic versioning scheme. This scheme consists of three numbers separated by periods in the form `X.Y.Z`, for example: `9.0.0`.

Each number represents a specific level of change:

- **Major (X)**: Indicates significant changes, such as new features, breaking changes, and major enhancements. Upgrading to a new major version may require changes to your existing setup and configurations.
- **Minor (Y)**: Introduces new features and improvements, while maintaining backward compatibility with the previous minor versions within the same major version. Upgrading to a new minor version should not require any changes to your existing setup.
- **Patch (Z)**: Contains bug fixes and security updates, without introducing new features or breaking changes. Upgrading to a new patch version should be seamless and not require any changes to your existing setup.

It's important to understand this versioning system, for compatibility and [upgrade](/deploy-manage/upgrade.md) planning.

## Availability of features

Elastic products and features have different availability states across deployment types and lifecycle stages.

Features may have different availability states between:

- **Deployment type**: The environment where the feature is available (Stack, Serverless, ECE, ECK, etc.)
- **Lifecycle state**: The development or support status of the feature (GA, Beta, etc.)
- **Version**: The specific version the lifecycle state applies to

#### Lifecycle states

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Generally Available (GA)** | Production-ready feature (default if not specified) |
| **Beta** | Feature is nearing general availability but not yet production-ready |
| **Technical preview** | Feature is in early development stage |
| **Coming** | Feature announced for a future release |
| **Discontinued** | Feature is being phased out |
| **Unavailable** | Feature is not supported in this deployment type or version |

### Where feature availability may differ

Features may have different states between:

- **[Elastic Stack](the-stack.md)** versions (e.g., 9.0, 9.1)
- **Deployment types** (and deployment versions)
  - [Elastic Cloud Hosted](/deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/cloud-hosted.md)
  - [Elastic Cloud Serverless](/deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/serverless.md)
  - [Self-managed deployments](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed.md)
  - [Elastic Cloud Enterprise (ECE)](/deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-enterprise.md)
    - ECE deployment versions (for example, 4.0.0)
  - [Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK)](/deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-on-k8s.md)
    - ECK deployment versions (for example, 3.0.0)
- **Serverless project types**
  - Security
  - Elasticsearch
  - Observability

### Important tips when reading the docs

- Always check feature lifecycle state for your specific deployment type and version
- Pay attention to Elastic Stack version requirements
- Note that Serverless features may vary by project type

### Availability badges in the docs

Our documentation uses badges to help you quickly identify where and when features are available for your specific environment.

Badges can appear in two places:
1. **Page headers**: Shows the overall availability across all deployment types
2. **Section headers**: Indicates specific availability for content in that section

### How to read the badges

Here are some examples to help you understand how to read the availability badges.

#### Example #1: Stack only feature

```yaml {applies_to}
stack: ga 9.1
```
- **Deployment type**: Elastic Stack
- **Version**: 9.1
- **Lifecycle**: Generally Available (GA) â€” default state

#### Example #2: Serverless-only feature with project differences

```yaml {applies_to}
serverless:
  security: beta
  elasticsearch: ga
```
- **Deployment type**: Serverless
- **Lifecycle**:
  - Beta for Security projects
  - Generally Available for Elasticsearch projects

#### Example #3: Discontinued feature on one deployment type

```yaml {applies_to}
deployment:
  ece: discontinued 4.1.0
```
- **Deployment type**: Elastic Cloud Enterprise
- **Lifecycle**: Discontinued
- **Version**: 4.1.0

## Find docs for your product version

In April 2025, we released our new documentation site. This site includes documentation for our latest product versions.

You can access the previous version of a page, where available, by clicking the **View previous version** link in the sidebar.
