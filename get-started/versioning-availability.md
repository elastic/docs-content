# Versioning and availability in Elastic Docs

Learn how Elastic Docs handles versioning, feature availability, and how to find the right documentation for your deployment type and product version. Find answers to common questions about the Elastic Stack versioning and to help you confidently navigate our continuously updated documentation.

## Frequently asked questions

### Where can I find documentation for the latest version of the {{stack}}?

Youâ€™re in the right place! All documentation for Elastic Stack 9.0.0 and later is available at [elastic.co/docs](https://www.elastic.co/docs), including the latest {{version.stack| M.M}} version and any future versions in the 9.x series.

Need docs for an earlier version? Go to [elastic.co/guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide).

### Why doesn't Elastic have separate documentation for each version?

Starting with {{stack}} 9.0.0, Elastic no longer publishes separate documentation sets for each minor release. Instead, all changes in the 9.x series are included in a single, continuously updated documentation set.

This approach helps:
* Reduce duplicate pages
* Show the full history and context of a feature
* Simplify search and navigation

### How do I know content was added in a specific version?

We clearly mark content added or changed in a specific version using availability badges. The availability badges appear in page and section headers. 

#### Elastic Stack example

```{applies_to}
stack: ga 9.1
```

This means the feature is:
* Available on Elastic Stack
* Generally Available (GA)
* Introduced in version 9.1.0

#### Serverless example

```yaml {applies_to}
serverless:
  security: beta
  elasticsearch: ga
```
* Applies to {{serverless-full}} 
* Generally Available for {{es}} projects
* Beta for {{elastic-sec}} projects

#### Elastic Cloud Enterprise example

```yaml {applies_to}
deployment:
  ece: deprecated 4.1.0
```
* Applies to {{ece}}
* Deprecated starting in {{ece}} version 4.1.0

:::

### What if I'm using a version earlier than {{stack}} 9.0.0?

Documentation for {{stack}} 8.19.0 and earlier is available at [elastic.co/guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide).

If a previous version for a specific page exists, you can select the version from the dropdown in the page sidebar. 

### How often is the documentation updated?

We frequently update Elastic Docs to reflect the following:
* Minor versions, such as {{stack}} 9.1.0 
* Patch-level updates, such as {{stack}} 9.1.1
* Ongoing improvements to clarify and expand guidance

To learn what's changed, check the [release notes](/release-notes/index.md) for each Elastic product.

% ### How do I know what the current {{stack}} version is?

% To make sure you're always viewing the most up-to-date and relevant documentation, the version dropdown at the % top of each page shows the most recent 9.x release. For example, Elastic Stack 9.0+ (latest: 9.1.0).

## Understanding {{stack}} versioning

{{stack}} uses semantic versioning in the `X.Y.Z` format, such as `9.0.0`.

| Version | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Major (X)** | Indicates significant changes, such as new features, breaking changes, and major enhancements. Upgrading to a new major version may require changes to your existing setup and configurations. |
| **Minor (Y)** | Introduces new features and improvements, while maintaining backward compatibility with the previous minor versions within the same major version. Upgrading to a new minor version should not require any changes to your existing setup. |
| **Patch (Z)** | Contains bug fixes and security updates, without introducing new features or breaking changes. Upgrading to a new patch version should be seamless and not require any changes to your existing setup. |

Understanding {{stack}} versioning is essential for [upgrade planning](/deploy-manage/upgrade.md) and ensuring compatibility.

## Availability of features

The features available to you can differ based on deployment type, product lifecycle stage, and specific version.

### Feature availability factors

| Factor | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Deployment type** | The environment where the feature is available, for example, {{stack}}, {{serverless-full}}, {{ece}} (ECE), {{eck}} (ECK) |
| **Lifecycle state** | The development or support status of the feature, for example, GA and Beta |
| **Version** | The specific version the lifecycle state applies to |

### Lifecycle states

| Lifecycle state | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Generally Available (GA)** | Production-ready feature. When unspecified, GA is the default |
| **Beta** | Feature is nearing general availability but not yet production-ready |
| **Technical preview** | Feature is in early development stage |
| **Unavailable** | Feature is not supported in this deployment type or version |

### Examples of where availability can vary

| Category | Example |
|-------|-------------|
| **Elastic Stack versions** | [Elastic Stack](the-stack.md) version 9.0.0 and later, including 9.1.0 |
| **Deployment types** | [Elastic Cloud Serverless](/deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/serverless.md), [Elastic Cloud Hosted](/deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/cloud-hosted.md), [Elastic Cloud Enterprise (ECE)](/deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-enterprise.md), [Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK)](/deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-on-k8s.md), and [Self-managed deployments](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed.md) |
