# Choose your use case

Choosing the right use case for your trial is crucial to demonstrating value quickly. Elastic offers three primary solutions, each designed for specific organizational needs. This guide helps you identify which solution best addresses your immediate challenges.

## Quick decision guide

Answer these questions to identify your primary use case:

| Question | Use case |
|----------|----------------|
| Do you need to build search experiences for users or search large volumes of data? | **Search** |
| Are you troubleshooting application performance, system health, or infrastructure issues? | **Observability** |
| Do you need to detect, investigate, or respond to security threats? | **Security** |
| Are you trying to understand user behavior or analyze business data? | **Search** or **Observability** |
| Do you need to monitor compliance or audit access to systems? | **Security** |

## Solution overview

### Elasticsearch (search)

**Best for**: Building search experiences, analyzing business data, and gaining insights from large datasets.

**Common use cases**:
- Website or application search
- E-commerce product catalogs
- Enterprise knowledge management
- Log and event search
- Business analytics and dashboards
- Full-text search across documents

**Your organization might need this if**:
- Users struggle to find information across multiple systems.
- You need to search and analyze large volumes of unstructured data.
- You're building an application that requires fast, relevant search.
- You want to create custom analytics dashboards for business data.

**What you will build in your trial**:
- A searchable index of your data (documents, products, or events).
- Custom search queries with filters and relevance tuning.
- Basic analytics and visualizations.
- An efficient search interface or dashboard.

**Time to value**: See search results within 1-2 hours of ingesting data.

### Elastic Observability

**Best for**: Monitoring applications, infrastructure, and services to ensure reliability and performance.

**Common use cases**:
- Application performance monitoring (APM)
- Infrastructure and container monitoring
- Log aggregation and analysis
- Service-level objective (SLO) tracking
- Incident investigation and root cause analysis
- Real user monitoring (RUM)

**Your organization might need this if**:
- Applications are slow or experiencing errors.
- You have limited visibility into system performance.
- Logs exist across multiple systems.
- You need to meet service-level agreements (SLAs) or track system uptime.
- Troubleshooting incidents takes too long.

**What you will build in your trial**:
- Monitoring for 2-3 key services or hosts.
- Log aggregation from critical applications.
- Performance dashboards and health metrics.
- Alerting for important thresholds.
- APM instrumentation for one application.

**Time to value**: See metrics and logs within 30 minutes to 1 hour.

### Elastic Security

**Best for**: Detecting, investigating, and responding to security threats and vulnerabilities.

**Common use cases**:
- Security information and event management (SIEM)
- Endpoint protection and detection (EDR)
- Threat hunting and investigation
- Vulnerability management
- Security analytics and reporting
- Compliance monitoring

**Your organization might need this if**:
- You need to detect and respond to security threats.
- Security logs are difficult to analyze.
- You want to monitor for suspicious activity.
- Compliance requires security event tracking.
- Incident response is manual and time-consuming.

**What you will build in your trial**:
- Security data ingestion from key systems (endpoints, network, cloud).
- Detection rules for common threats.
- Security dashboards and timelines.
- Alert workflows and case management.
- Basic threat hunting capabilities.

**Time to value**: See security events and detections within 1-2 hours.

## Multi-solution approaches

Many organizations benefit from multiple Elastic solutions working together. However, for your trial, we recommend starting with one primary use case to demonstrate clear value quickly.

### Common combinations

After your initial PoC, consider these complementary solutions:

- Observability and Security: Monitor application health and detect security threats in the same platform.
- Search and Observability: Build search experiences while monitoring application performance.
- Security and Search: Search security events while maintaining threat detection capabilities.

## Next steps

After you've selected your use case:

1. Review the solution documentation:
   - [Search documentation](/solutions/search.md)
   - [Observability documentation](/solutions/observability.md)
   - [Security documentation](/solutions/security.md)

2. Continue to Week 1: [Week 1: Foundation and first use case](/get-started/trial-week-1.md) to start building your PoC.

:::{tip}
You can always expand to additional use cases after your initial PoC. Many successful Elastic implementations start with one solution and grow into comprehensive platforms that address multiple needs.
