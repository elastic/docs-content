# Installing the Elastic Stack [installing-elastic-stack]

When installing the Elastic Stack, you must use the same version across the entire stack. For example, if you are using Elasticsearch 9.0.0-beta1, you install Beats 9.0.0-beta1, APM Server 9.0.0-beta1, Elasticsearch Hadoop 9.0.0-beta1, Kibana 9.0.0-beta1, and Logstash 9.0.0-beta1.

If you’re upgrading an existing installation, see [Upgrading the Elastic Stack](../deploy-manage/upgrade/deployment-or-cluster.md) for information about how to ensure compatibility with 9.0.0-beta1.

For an example of installing and configuring the {{stack}}, you can try out our [Tutorial 1: Installing a self-managed {{stack}}](../deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/installing-elasticsearch.md). After that, you can also learn how to secure your installation for production following the steps in [Tutorial 2: Securing a self-managed {{stack}}](../deploy-manage/security/secure-your-cluster-deployment.md).


## Network requirements [network-requirements] 

To install the Elastic Stack on-premises, the following ports need to be open for each component.

| Default port | Component |
| --- | --- |
| 3002 | {{ents}} |
| 5044 | {{agent}} → {{ls}}<br>{{beats}} → {{ls}} |
| 5601 | {{kib}}<br>{{agent}} → {{fleet}}<br>{{fleet-server}} → {{fleet}} |
| 8220 | {{agent}} → {{fleet-server}}<br>APM Server |
| 9200-9300 | {{es}} REST API |
| 9300-9400 | {{es}} node transport and communication |
| 9600-9700 | {{ls}} REST API |

Each Elastic integration has its own ports and dependencies. Verify these ports and dependencies before installation. Refer to [{{integrations}}](https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations).

For more information on supported network configurations, refer to [{{es}} Ingest Architectures](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ingest/current).


## Installation order [install-order-elastic-stack] 

Install the Elastic Stack products you want to use in the following order:

1. [Elasticsearch]({{ref}}/install-elasticsearch.html)
2. [Kibana]({{kibana-ref}}/install.html) 
3. [Logstash]({{logstash-ref}}/installing-logstash.html)
4. [Elastic Agent]({{fleet-guide}}/elastic-agent-installation.html) or [Beats]({{beats-ref}}/getting-started.html)
5. [APM]({{apm-guide-ref}}/apm-quick-start.html)
6. [Elasticsearch Hadoop]({{hadoop-ref}}/install.html)

Installing in this order ensures that the components each product depends on are in place.
