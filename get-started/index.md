# Get started

## Overview

{{es}} is the heart of the [Elastic Stack](the-stack.md). Combined with {{kib}}, it powers these Elastic solutions and use cases:

* [Observability](/solutions/observability.md)
* [Security](/solutions/security.md)
* [Search](/solutions/search.md)

:::{tip}
Refer to our [customer success stories](https://www.elastic.co/customers/success-stories) for concrete examples of how Elastic is used in real-world scenarios.
