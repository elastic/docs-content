elastic.co/docs uses our new build system, also known as "Docs V3", which uses an extended version of markdown as its markup language. Refer to our [syntax guide](../../syntax/index.md) to learn more.

Docs for {{stack}} 9.x, {{ece}} 4.x, and {{eck}} 3.x can all be found on this site. All unversioned products, such as {{ech}} and {{serverless-full}}, are also documented on elastic.co/docs.

This documentation is **cumulative**. This means that a new set of docs is not published for every minor release. Instead, each page stays valid over time and incorporates version-specific changes directly within the content. [Learn how to write cumulative documentation](../how-to/cumulative-docs/index.md).
