:::{tip}
If you're working in [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) or [github.dev](https://github.dev), you can install the [VS Code extension](tools.md#vs-code-extension) to simplify the authoring experience.

## Making quick edits

For content hosted on [elastic.co/docs](https://www.elastic.co/docs), most conceptual and narrative content is stored in the [`docs-content`](https://github.com/elastic/docs-content) repository, and most reference content is hosted in the relevant product's repository.

To make quick edits to a single page:

1. Navigate to the documentation page that needs updates.
2. Click the **Edit this page** button. This opens the file in GitHub's editor.

3. Make your changes in the editor.
4. Click **Commit changes**.
5. Write a clear, verb-focused commit message describing your changes.
6. Select **Propose changes**. This takes you to the pull request creation page where you can edit the description if necessary.
7. Select **Create pull request** to submit your changes.

For more details on editing files on GitHub, refer to [GitHub's documentation on editing files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files).
