# Elastic Docs contribution guide

Welcome, **contributor**!

Whether you're a technical writer or you've only edited Elastic docs once or twice, you're a valued contributor. Every word matters!

## Contribute to the docs [#contribute]

In April 2025, we released our new documentation site. This site includes documentation for our latest product versions, including {{stack}} 9.0+ and {{serverless-full}}.

* For **simple bug fixes and enhancements**: [Contribute on the web](on-the-web.md)
* For **complex or multi-page updates**: [Contribute locally](locally.md)

#### Branches in V3

In Docs V3, a single branch is published per repository. This branch is set to `main` by default, but it is possible to instead publish a different branch by changing your repository's deployment model. You might want to change your deployment model so you can have more control over when content added for a specific release is published.
