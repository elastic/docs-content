:::{tip} - Use applies-switch instead of traditional tabs

When you'd like to build a tabbed experience for content that varies specifically between two or more versions, or between two or more deployment types, prefer using [applies-switch](/syntax/applies-switch.md) over regular [tabs](/syntax/tabs.md).

**Applies-switch** natively support using `applies_to` metadata keys as tab titles and offer a more consistent experience with recognizable badges.
