:::{note}
Tutorials differ from how-to guides in scope and purpose:

- **[How-to guides](/contribute-docs/content-types/how-tos.md)** are focused recipes for a single, discrete task with minimal explanation
- **[Tutorials](/contribute-docs/content-types/tutorials.md)** chain multiple tasks together with explanatory context

::::{tip}
If your content has more than 10 overall steps or requires significant explanation between steps, use a tutorial.
