| Word | Status | Usage notes |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- |
| **abort** | 🔴 Avoid | This word can be offensive. Use _shut down,_ _cancel,_ or _stop_ instead. |
| **above** | 🟠 Use with caution | Don't use to refer to a position. Directional language does not meet accessibility requirements.|
| **add** | 🟢 Preferred | Use for establishing a new relationship.  Often used in create-then-add scenarios: _Create a dashboard, then add a visualization_. _Remove_ is the correct opposite. |
| **app**, **application**| 🟠 Use with caution | Use only when needed for clarity.  Otherwise, a Kibana app name can stand alone.  _App_ is a well-known abbreviation for _application_ and is preferred. |
| **begin** | 🟠 Use with caution | Similar to _start_, using _begin_ depends on the context. _Begin a procedure,_ _begin an analysis,_ or _begin an installation_ are common phrases. Similarly, _start a program,_ _start an engine,_ or _start a timer_ are frequently used.  _Start_ is considered less formal than _begin_. _End_ is the correct opposite of _begin_.|
| **below** | 🟠 Use with caution | Don't use to refer to a position. Directional language does not meet accessibility requirements.|

| **kill** | 🟠 Use with caution | Use _cancel_ or _stop_ unless the actual command is `kill`. |
| **launch** | 🔴 Avoid | Use _open_ instead.  |
| **may** | 🟠 Use with caution | Use _may_ for permissibility. Use _can_ for capability. Use _might_ for possibility.  |
| **open** | 🟢 Preferred | Use instead of _launch_.  |
| **please** | 🔴 Avoid | In most cases, _please_ is unnecessary. Exceptions are situations where the user must wait or do something inconvenient. Or, if the text sounds too abrupt without it.  |
