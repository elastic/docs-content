# Comments

## Single line comments

Use `%` to add single-line comments.

```markdown
% This is a comment
```

Make sure to add a space after the `%`.

## Multiline comments

Use `<!--` and `-->` to add multiple line comment blocks.

```markdown
- There is a commented section below.
<!--
This section should not appear -
Neither should this line.
-->
- And there is a commented section above.
```
