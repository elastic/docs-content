# Search your data [elasticsearch-search-your-data]

Searching your data in {{es-serverless}} works the same way as in other Elasticsearch deployments. If you haven’t used {{es}} before, you can learn the basics in the [core {{es}} documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/elasticsearch-intro.html).

You can use the [{{es-serverless}} REST APIs](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch-serverless) to search your data using any HTTP client, including the [{{es}} client libraries](../../../solutions/search/site-or-app/clients.md), or directly in [Console](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/serverless/current/devtools-run-api-requests-in-the-console.html).

You can also run searches using [Discover](../../../explore-analyze/discover.md) in your project’s UI.

Try our hands-on [quick start tutorials](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/quickstart.html#quickstart-list) in the core {{es}} documentation to get started, or check out our [Python notebooks](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-labs/tree/main/notebooks#readme).
