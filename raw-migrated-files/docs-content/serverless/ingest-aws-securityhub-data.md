# Ingest AWS Security Hub data [ingest-aws-securityhub-data]

In order to enrich your {{elastic-sec}} workflows with third-party cloud security posture data collected by AWS Security Hub:

* Follow the steps to [set up the AWS Security Hub integration](https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/aws/securityhub).
* Make sure the integration version is at least 2.31.1.
* Ensure you have `read` privileges for the `security_solution-*.misconfiguration_latest` index.
* While configuring the AWS Security Hub integration, turn on **Collect AWS Security Hub Findings from AWS**. We recommend you also set the **Initial Interval** value to `2160h` (equivalent to 90 days) to ingest existing logs.

After youâ€™ve completed these steps, AWS Security Hub data will appear on the **Misconfigurations** tab of the [**Findings**](../../../solutions/security/cloud/findings-page.md) page.

Any available findings data will also appear in the entity details flyouts for related [alerts](../../../solutions/security/detect-and-alert/view-detection-alert-details.md#insights-section). If alerts are present for a user or host that has findings data from AWS Security Hub, the findings will appear on the [users](/solutions/security/explore/users-page.md#user-details-flyout), and [hosts](/solutions/security/explore/hosts-page.md#host-details-flyout) flyouts.
