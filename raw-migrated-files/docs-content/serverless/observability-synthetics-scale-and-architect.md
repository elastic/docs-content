# Scale and architect a Synthetics deployment [observability-synthetics-scale-and-architect]


Use these advanced considerations when using Elastic Synthetics for large and complex use cases.


## Manage large numbers of Synthetic monitors with tags [synthetics-tagging] 

When managing larger numbers of synthetic monitors, use tags to keep them organized. Many of the views in the Synthetics UI are tag-aware and can group data by tag.


## Create custom dashboards [synthetics-custom-dashboards] 

If we donâ€™t provide a UI for your exact needs, you can use [dashboards](../../../solutions/observability/get-started/get-started-with-dashboards.md) to build custom visualizations.
