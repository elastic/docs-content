# Ingest Wiz data [ingest-wiz-data]

In order to enrich your {{elastic-sec}} workflows with third-party cloud security posture and vulnerability data collected by Wiz:

* Follow the steps to [set up the Wiz integration](https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/wiz).
* Make sure the integration version is at least 2.0.1.
* Ensure you have `read` privileges for the following indices: `security_solution-*.misconfiguration_latest`, `security_solution-*.vulnerability_latest`.
* While configuring the Wiz integration, turn on **Cloud Configuration Finding logs** and **Vulnerability logs**. We recommend you also set the **Initial Interval** values for both settings to `2160h` (equivalent to 90 days) to ingest existing logs.

After youâ€™ve completed these steps, Wiz data will appear on the **[**Misconfiguations**](../../../solutions/security/cloud/findings-page.md) and [**Vulnerabilities**](../../../solutions/security/cloud/findings-page-3.md) tabs of the **Findings** page.

Any available findings data will also appear in the entity details flyouts for related [alerts](../../../solutions/security/detect-and-alert/view-detection-alert-details.md#insights-section). If alerts are present for a user or host that has findings data from Wiz, the findings will appear on the [users](../../../solutions/security/explore/users-page.md#security-users-page-user-details-flyout), and [hosts](../../../solutions/security/explore/hosts-page.md#security-hosts-overview-host-details-flyout) flyouts.
