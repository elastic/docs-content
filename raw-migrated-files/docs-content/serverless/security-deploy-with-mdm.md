# Deploy {{elastic-defend}} on macOS with mobile device management [security-deploy-with-mdm]


To silently install and deploy {{elastic-defend}} without the need for user interaction, you need to configure a mobile device management (MDM) profile for {{elastic-endpoint}}â€”the installed component that performs {{elastic-defend}}'s threat monitoring and prevention. This allows you to pre-approve the {{elastic-endpoint}} system extension and grant Full Disk Access to all the necessary components.

This page explains how to deploy {{elastic-defend}} silently using Jamf.


## Configure a Jamf MDM profile [security-deploy-with-mdm-configure-a-jamf-mdm-profile]

In Jamf, create a configuration profile for {{elastic-endpoint}}. Follow these steps to configure the profile:

1. [Approve the system extension](../../../solutions/security/configure-elastic-defend/deploy-on-macos-with-mdm.md#security-deploy-with-mdm-approve-the-system-extension).
2. [Approve network content filtering](../../../solutions/security/configure-elastic-defend/deploy-on-macos-with-mdm.md#security-deploy-with-mdm-approve-network-content-filtering).
3. [Enable notifications](../../../solutions/security/configure-elastic-defend/deploy-on-macos-with-mdm.md#security-deploy-with-mdm-enable-notifications).
4. [Enable Full Disk Access](../../../solutions/security/configure-elastic-defend/deploy-on-macos-with-mdm.md#security-deploy-with-mdm-enable-full-disk-access).


### Approve the system extension [security-deploy-with-mdm-approve-the-system-extension]

1. Select the **System Extensions** option to configure the system extension policy for the {{elastic-endpoint}} configuration profile.
2. Make sure that **Allow users to approve system extensions** is selected.
3. In the **Allowed Team IDs and System Extensions** section, add the {{elastic-endpoint}} system extension:

    1. (Optional) Enter a **Display Name** for the {{elastic-endpoint}} system extension.
    2. From the **System Extension Types** dropdown, select **Allowed System Extensions**.
    3. Under **Team Identifier**, enter `2BT3HPN62Z`.
    4. Under **Allowed System Extensions**, enter `co.elastic.systemextension`.

4. Save the configuration.
