To get more details about your account usage:

1. Navigate to [cloud.elastic.co](https://cloud.elastic.co/) and log in to your {{ecloud}} account.
2. In the header bar, click the user icon, then select **Billing**.

On the **Usage** tab of the **Billing** page, you can:

* Monitor usage for the current month, including month-to-date usage
* Check the usage breakdown for a selected time range
* View usage totals by product

The usage breakdown information is an estimate. To get the exact amount you owe for a given month, check your invoices in the [billing history](../../../deploy-manage/cloud-organization/billing/view-billing-history.md).
