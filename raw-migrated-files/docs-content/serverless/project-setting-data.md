# Manage project data [project-setting-data]


Go to **Project settings**, then ** Management** to manage your indices, data views, saved objects, settings, and more. You can also open Management by using the [global search field](../../../explore-analyze/query-filter/filtering.md#_finding_your_apps_and_objects).

Access to individual features is governed by Elastic user roles. Consult your administrator if you do not have the appropriate access. To learn more about roles, refer to [Assign user roles and privileges](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cloud-organization/user-roles.md#general-assign-user-roles).
