# Behavioral detection use cases [security-behavioral-detection-use-cases]

Behavioral detection identifies potential internal and external threats based on user and host activity. It uses a threat-centric approach to flag suspicious activity by analyzing patterns, anomalies, and context enrichment.

The behavioral detection feature is built on {{elastic-sec}}'s foundational SIEM detection capabilities, leveraging {{ml}} algorithms to enable proactive threat detection and hunting.


## Elastic integrations for behavioral detection use cases [security-behavioral-detection-use-cases-elastic-integrations-for-behavioral-detection-use-cases] 

Behavioral detection integrations provide a convenient way to enable behavioral detection capabilities. They streamline the deployment of components that implement behavioral detection, such as data ingestion, transforms, rules, {{ml}} jobs, and scripts.

::::{admonition} Requirements
:class: note

* Behavioral detection integrations require the Security Analytics Complete [project feature](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/project-settings.md).
* To learn more about the requirements for using {{ml}} jobs, refer to [{{ml-cap}} job and rule requirements](../../../solutions/security/advanced-entity-analytics/machine-learning-job-rule-requirements.md).

Hereâ€™s a list of integrations for various behavioral detection use cases:

* [Data Exfiltration Detection](https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/ded)
* [Domain Generation Algorithm Detection](https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/dga)
* [Lateral Movement Detection](https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/lmd)
* [Living off the Land Attack Detection](https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/problemchild)
* [Network Beaconing Identification](https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/beaconing)

To learn more about {{ml}} jobs enabled by these integrations, refer to [Prebuilt job reference](asciidocalypse://docs/docs-content/docs/reference/security/prebuilt-jobs.md).
