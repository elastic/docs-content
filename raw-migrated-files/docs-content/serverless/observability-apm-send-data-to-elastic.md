Send APM data to Elastic with:

* **[Elastic APM agents](../../../solutions/observability/apps/elastic-apm-agents.md):** Elastic APM agents are lightweight libraries you install in your applications and services. They automatically instrument supported technologies, and offer APIs for custom code instrumentation.
* **[OpenTelemetry](../../../solutions/observability/apps/use-opentelemetry-with-apm.md):** OpenTelemetry is a set of APIs, SDKs, tooling, and integrations that enable the capture and management of telemetry data from your services and applications.

Elastic also supports instrumentation of [AWS Lambda functions](../../../solutions/observability/apps/monitoring-aws-lambda-functions.md).
