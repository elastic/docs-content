# Manage billing of your organization [general-manage-billing]


Manage the billing details of your organization directly from the Elastic Cloud console. Bills are invoiced according to the billing contact and details that you set for your organization.

1. Navigate to [cloud.elastic.co](https://cloud.elastic.co/) and log in to your Elastic Cloud account.
2. Go to the user icon on the header bar and select **Billing**.

From the **Billing pages**, you can perform the following tasks:

* [Check your subscription overview](../../../deploy-manage/cloud-organization/billing/manage-subscription.md)
* [Monitor and analyze your account usage](../../../deploy-manage/cloud-organization/billing/monitor-analyze-usage.md)
* [Check your billing history](../../../deploy-manage/cloud-organization/billing/view-billing-history.md)

If you have a project that youâ€™re no longer using, refer to [Stop charges for a project](../../../deploy-manage/cloud-organization/billing/stop-charges-for-project-deployment.md).

To learn about the serverless pricing model, refer to [Serverless billing dimensions](../../../deploy-manage/cloud-organization/billing/serverless-project-billing-dimensions.md) and our [pricing page](https://www.elastic.co/pricing/serverless-search).
