# Filter and search application data [observability-apm-filter-and-search-data]


Because Elastic APM is built on top of the {{stack}}, you have the full power of Elasticâ€™s powerful search capabilities to filter and search through your application data. Mastering how to filter and search your data can help you find bottlenecks in your code faster:

* Use global filters to [filter data](../../../solutions/observability/apps/filter-application-data.md) across the Applications UI based on a specific time range or environment.
* Use [advanced queries](../../../solutions/observability/apps/use-advanced-queries-on-application-data.md) on your data to filter on specific pieces of information.
