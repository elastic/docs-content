# Machine learning and AIOps [observability-machine-learning]


The machine learning capabilities available in {{obs-serverless}} enable you to consume and process large observability data sets at scale, reducing the time and effort required to detect, understand, investigate, and resolve incidents. Built on predictive analytics and {{ml}}, our AIOps capabilities require no prior experience with {{ml}}. DevOps engineers, SREs, and security analysts can get started right away using these AIOps features with little or no advanced configuration:

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Anomaly detection](../../../explore-analyze/machine-learning/aiops-labs/observability-aiops-detect-anomalies.md) | Detect anomalies by comparing real-time and historical data from different sources to look for unusual, problematic patterns. |
| [Log rate analysis](../../../explore-analyze/machine-learning/aiops-labs/observability-aiops-analyze-spikes.md) | Find and investigate the causes of unusual spikes or drops in log rates. |
| [Change point detection](../../../explore-analyze/machine-learning/aiops-labs/observability-aiops-detect-change-points.md) | Detect distribution changes, trend changes, and other statistically significant change points in a metric of your time series data. |
