# Alerting [create-alerts]

::::{important} 
Make sure alerting is already set up in {{kib}}. For details, see [Setup and prerequisites](../../../explore-analyze/alerts-cases/alerts/alerting-setup.md).

::::


Alerting enables you to detect complex conditions defined by a **rule** within the Applications, Logs, Infrastructure, Synthetics, and Uptime UIs. When a condition is met, the rule tracks it as an **alert** and responds by triggering one or more **actions**.

Alerts and rules related to service-level objectives (SLOs), and {{observability}} apps, including Applications, Logs, Infrastructure, Synthetics, and Uptime, can be managed in the {{observability}} UI. You can also manage {{observability}} app rules alongside rules for other apps from the [{{kib}} Management UI](../../../explore-analyze/alerts-cases/alerts/create-manage-rules.md).
