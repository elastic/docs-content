# Cases [create-cases]

Collect and share information about observability issues by opening a case directly in the Elastic {{observability}} app. Cases allow you to track key investigation details, add assignees and tags to your cases, set their severity and status, and add alerts, comments, and visualizations. You can also send cases to third party systems by [configuring external connectors](../../../solutions/observability/incident-management/configure-case-settings.md#cases-external-connectors).

You can also optionally add custom fields and case templates. [preview]

::::{note}
If you create cases in {{stack-manage-app}} or the {{security-app}}, they are not visible in {{observability}}. Likewise, the cases you create in {{observability}} are not visible in {{stack-manage-app}} or the {{security-app}}. You also cannot attach alerts from {{stack-manage-app}} or the {{security-app}} to cases in {{observability}}.
