# Monitoring AWS Lambda Functions [apm-monitoring-aws-lambda]


Elastic APM lets you monitor your AWS Lambda functions. The natural integration of [distributed tracing](../../../solutions/observability/apps/traces.md#apm-distributed-tracing) into your AWS Lambda functions provides insights into the functionâ€™s execution and runtime behavior as well as its relationships and dependencies to other services.

To get started with the setup of Elastic APM for your Lambda functions, checkout the language-specific guides:

* [Quick Start with APM on AWS Lambda - Node.js](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/nodejs/current/lambda.html)
* [Quick Start with APM on AWS Lambda - Python](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/python/current/lambda-support.html)
* [Quick Start with APM on AWS Lambda - Java](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/java/current/aws-lambda.html)

Or, see the [architecture guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/lambda/current/aws-lambda-arch.html) to learn more about how the extension works, performance impacts, and more.
