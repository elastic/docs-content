# Monitoring AWS Lambda Functions [apm-monitoring-aws-lambda]


Elastic APM lets you monitor your AWS Lambda functions. The natural integration of [distributed tracing](../../../solutions/observability/apps/traces.md#apm-distributed-tracing) into your AWS Lambda functions provides insights into the functionâ€™s execution and runtime behavior as well as its relationships and dependencies to other services.

To get started with the setup of Elastic APM for your Lambda functions, checkout the language-specific guides:

* [Quick Start with APM on AWS Lambda - Node.js](asciidocalypse://docs/apm-agent-nodejs/docs/reference/ingestion-tools/apm-agent-nodejs/lambda.md)
* [Quick Start with APM on AWS Lambda - Python](asciidocalypse://docs/apm-agent-python/docs/reference/ingestion-tools/apm-agent-python/lambda-support.md)
* [Quick Start with APM on AWS Lambda - Java](asciidocalypse://docs/apm-agent-java/docs/reference/ingestion-tools/apm-agent-java/aws-lambda.md)

Or, see the [architecture guide](asciidocalypse://docs/apm-aws-lambda/docs/reference/ingestion-tools/apm-lambda/index.md) to learn more about how the extension works, performance impacts, and more.
