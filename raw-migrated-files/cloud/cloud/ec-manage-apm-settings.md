# Edit APM user settings [ec-manage-apm-settings]

Change how Elastic APM runs by providing your own user settings. Starting in {{stack}} version 8.0, how you change APM settings and the settings that are available to you depend on how you spin up Elastic APM. There are two modes:

{{fleet}}-managed APM integration
:   New deployments created in {{stack}} version 8.0 and later will be managed by {{fleet}}.

    Check [APM configuration reference](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/observability/current/apm-configuring-howto-apm-server.html) for information on how to configure Elastic APM in this mode.


Standalone APM Server (legacy)
:   Deployments created prior to {{stack}} version 8.0 are in legacy mode. Upgrading to or past {{stack}} 8.0 will not remove you from legacy mode.

    Check [Edit standalone APM settings (legacy)](../../../solutions/observability/apps/configure-apm-server.md#ec-edit-apm-standalone-settings) and [Supported standalone APM settings (legacy)](../../../solutions/observability/apps/configure-apm-server.md#ec-apm-settings) for information on how to configure Elastic APM in this mode.


To learn more about the differences between these modes, or to switch from Standalone APM Server (legacy) mode to {{fleet}}-managed, check [Switch to the Elastic APM integration](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/guide/current/upgrade-to-apm-integration.html).

## Edit standalone APM settings (legacy) [ec-edit-apm-standalone-settings]

User settings are appended to the `apm-server.yml` configuration file for your instance and provide custom configuration options.

To add user settings:

1. Log in to the [Elasticsearch Service Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
2. Find your deployment on the home page in the Elasticsearch Service card and select **Manage** to access it directly. Or, select **Hosted deployments** to go to the deployments page to view all of your deployments.

    On the deployments page you can narrow your deployments by name, ID, or choose from several other filters. To customize your view, use a combination of filters, or change the format from a grid to a list.

3. From your deployment menu, go to the **Edit** page.
4. In the **APM** section, select **Edit user settings**. (For existing deployments with user settings, you may have to expand the **Edit apm-server.yml** caret instead.)
5. Update the user settings.
6. Select **Save changes**.

::::{note}
If a setting is not supported by Elasticsearch Service, you will get an error message when you try to save.

## Supported standalone APM settings (legacy) [ec-apm-settings]

Elasticsearch Service supports the following setting when running APM in standalone mode (legacy).

::::{tip}
Some settings that could break your cluster if set incorrectly are blocklisted. The following settings are generally safe in cloud environments. For detailed information about APM settings, check the [APM documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/guide/current/configuring-howto-apm-server.html).

### Version 8.0+ [ec_version_8_0_3]

This stack version removes support for some previously supported settings. These are all of the supported settings for this version:

`apm-server.agent.config.cache.expiration`
:   When using APM agent configuration, determines cache expiration from information fetched from Kibana. Defaults to `30s`.

`apm-server.aggregation.transactions.*`
:   This functionality is experimental and may be changed or removed completely in a future release. When enabled, APM Server produces transaction histogram metrics that are used to power the APM app. Shifting this responsibility from APM app to APM Server results in improved query performance and removes the need to store unsampled transactions.

The following `apm-server.auth.anonymous.*` settings can be configured to restrict anonymous access to specified agents and/or services. This is primarily intended to allow limited access for untrusted agents, such as Real User Monitoring. Anonymous auth is automatically enabled when RUM is enabled. Otherwise, anonymous auth is disabled. When anonymous auth is enabled, only agents matching `allow_agent` and services matching `allow_service` are allowed. See below for details on default values for these.

`apm-server.auth.anonymous.allow_agent`
:   Allow anonymous access only for specified agents.

`apm-server.auth.anonymous.allow_service`
:   Allow anonymous access only for specified service names. By default, all service names are allowed. This is replacing the config option `apm-server.rum.allow_service_names`, previously available for `7.x` deployments.

`apm-server.auth.anonymous.rate_limit.event_limit`
:   Rate limiting is defined per unique client IP address, for a limited number of IP addresses. Sites with many concurrent clients should consider increasing this limit. Defaults to 1000. This is replacing the config option `apm-server.rum.event_rate.limit`, previously available for `7.x` deployments.

`apm-server.auth.anonymous.rate_limit.ip_limit`
:   Defines the maximum amount of events allowed per IP per second. Defaults to 300. The overall maximum event throughput for anonymous access is (event_limit * ip_limit). This is replacing the config option `apm-server.rum.event_rate.lru_size`, previously available for `7.x` deployments.

`apm-server.auth.api_key.enabled`
:   Enables agent authorization using Elasticsearch API Keys. This is replacing the config option `apm-server.api_key.enabled`, previously available for `7.x` deployments.

`apm-server.auth.api_key.limit`
:   Restrict how many unique API keys are allowed per minute. Should be set to at least the amount of different API keys configured in your monitored services. Every unique API key triggers one request to Elasticsearch. This is replacing the config option `apm-server.api_key.limit`, previously available for `7.x` deployments.

`apm-server.capture_personal_data`
:   When set to `true`, the server captures the IP of the instrumented service and its User Agent. Enabled by default.

`apm-server.default_service_environment`
:   If specified, APM Server will record this value in events which have no service environment defined, and add it to agent configuration queries to Kibana when none is specified in the request from the agent.

`apm-server.max_event_size`
:   Specifies the maximum allowed size of an event for processing by the server, in bytes. Defaults to `307200`.

`apm-server.rum.allow_headers`
:   A list of Access-Control-Allow-Headers to allow RUM requests, in addition to "Content-Type", "Content-Encoding", and "Accept".

`apm-server.rum.allow_origins`
:   A list of permitted origins for real user monitoring. User-agents will send an origin header that will be validated against this list. An origin is made of a protocol scheme, host, and port, without the URL path. Allowed origins in this setting can have a wildcard `*` to match anything (for example: `http://*.example.com`). If an item in the list is a single `*`, all origins will be allowed.

`apm-server.rum.enabled`
:   Enable Real User Monitoring (RUM) Support. By default RUM is enabled. RUM does not support token based authorization. Enabled RUM endpoints will not require any authorization configured for other endpoints.

`apm-server.rum.exclude_from_grouping`
:   A regexp to be matched against a stacktrace frame’s `file_name`. If the regexp matches, the stacktrace frame is not used for calculating error groups. The default pattern excludes stacktrace frames that have a filename starting with `/webpack`

`apm-server.rum.library_pattern`
:   A regexp to be matched against a stacktrace frame’s `file_name` and `abs_path` attributes. If the regexp matches, the stacktrace frame is considered to be a library frame.

`apm-server.rum.source_mapping.enabled`
:   If a source map has previously been uploaded, source mapping is automatically applied to all error and transaction documents sent to the RUM endpoint. Sourcemapping is enabled by default when RUM is enabled.

`apm-server.rum.source_mapping.cache.expiration`
:   The `cache.expiration` determines how long a source map should be cached in memory. Note that values configured without a time unit will be interpreted as seconds.

`apm-server.sampling.tail.enabled`
:   Set to `true` to enable tail based sampling. Disabled by default.

`apm-server.sampling.tail.policies`
:   Criteria used to match a root transaction to a sample rate.

`apm-server.sampling.tail.interval`
:   Synchronization interval for multiple APM Servers. Should be in the order of tens of seconds or low minutes.

`logging.level`
:   Sets the minimum log level. The default log level is error. Available log levels are: error, warning, info, or debug.

`logging.selectors`
:   Enable debug output for selected components. To enable all selectors use ["*"]. Other available selectors are "beat", "publish", or "service". Multiple selectors can be chained.

`logging.metrics.enabled`
:   If enabled, apm-server periodically logs its internal metrics that have changed in the last period. For each metric that changed, the delta from the value at the beginning of the period is logged. Also, the total values for all non-zero internal metrics are logged on shutdown. The default is false.

`logging.metrics.period`
:   The period after which to log the internal metrics. The default is 30s.

`max_procs`
:   Sets the maximum number of CPUs that can be executing simultaneously. The default is the number of logical CPUs available in the system.

`output.elasticsearch.flush_interval`
:   The maximum duration to accumulate events for a bulk request before being flushed to Elasticsearch. The value must have a duration suffix. The default is 1s.

`output.elasticsearch.flush_bytes`
:   The bulk request size threshold, in bytes, before flushing to Elasticsearch. The value must have a suffix. The default is 5MB.


### Version 7.17+ [ec_version_7_17]

This stack version includes all of the settings from 7.16 and the following:

Allow anonymous access only for specified agents and/or services. This is primarily intended to allow limited access for untrusted agents, such as Real User Monitoring. Anonymous auth is automatically enabled when RUM is enabled. Otherwise, anonymous auth is disabled. When anonymous auth is enabled, only agents matching allow_agent and services matching allow_service are allowed. See below for details on default values for these.

`apm-server.auth.anonymous.allow_agent`
:   Allow anonymous access only for specified agents.

`apm-server.auth.anonymous.allow_service`
:   Allow anonymous access only for specified service names. By default, all service names are allowed. This will be replacing the config option `apm-server.rum.allow_service_names` from `8.0` on.

`apm-server.auth.anonymous.rate_limit.event_limit`
:   Rate limiting is defined per unique client IP address, for a limited number of IP addresses. Sites with many concurrent clients should consider increasing this limit. Defaults to 1000. This will be replacing the config option`apm-server.rum.event_rate.limit` from `8.0` on.

`apm-server.auth.anonymous.rate_limit.ip_limit`
:   Defines the maximum amount of events allowed per IP per second. Defaults to 300. The overall maximum event throughput for anonymous access is (event_limit * ip_limit). This will be replacing the config option `apm-server.rum.event_rate.lru_size` from `8.0` on.

`apm-server.auth.api_key.enabled`
:   Enables agent authorization using Elasticsearch API Keys.  This will be replacing the config option `apm-server.api_key.enabled` from `8.0` on.

`apm-server.auth.api_key.limit`
:   Restrict how many unique API keys are allowed per minute. Should be set to at least the amount of different API keys configured in your monitored services. Every unique API key triggers one request to Elasticsearch. This will be replacing the config option `apm-server.api_key.limit` from `8.0` on.


### Supported versions before 8.x [ec_supported_versions_before_8_x_3]

`apm-server.aggregation.transactions.*`
