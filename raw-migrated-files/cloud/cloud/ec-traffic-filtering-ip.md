# IP traffic filters [ec-traffic-filtering-ip]

Traffic filtering, by IP address or CIDR block, is one of the security layers available in Elasticsearch Service. It allows you to limit how your deployments can be accessed. We have two types of filters available for filtering by IP address or CIDR block: Ingress/Inbound and Egress/Outbound (Beta, API only).

* **Ingress or inbound IP filters** - These restrict access to your deployments from a set of IP addresses or CIDR blocks. These filters are available through the Elasticsearch Service console.
* **Egress or outbound IP filters** - These restrict the set of IP addresses or CIDR blocks accessible from your deployment. These might be used to restrict access to a certain region or service. This feature is in beta and is currently only available through the [Traffic Filtering API](../../../deploy-manage/security/manage-traffic-filtering-through-api.md).

Read more about [Traffic Filtering](../../../deploy-manage/security/traffic-filtering.md) for the general concepts behind traffic filtering in Elasticsearch Service.

Follow the step described here to set up ingress or inbound IP filters through the Elasticsearch Service console.


## Create an IP filter rule set [ec-create-traffic-filter-ip-rule-set] 

You can combine any rules into a set, so we recommend that you group rules according to what they allow, and make sure to label them accordingly. Since multiple sets can be applied to a deployment, you can be as granular in your sets as you feel is necessary.

To create a rule set:

1. Log in to the [Elasticsearch Service Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
2. Find your deployment on the home page in the Elasticsearch Service card and select **Manage** to access it directly. Or, select **Hosted deployments** to go to the deployments page to view all of your deployments.
3. Under the **Features** tab, open the **Traffic filters** page.
4. Select **Create filter**.
5. Select **IP filtering rule set**.
6. Create your rule set, providing a meaningful name and description.
7. Select the region for the rule set.
8. Select if this rule set should be automatically attached to new deployments.

    ::::{note} 
    Each rule set is bound to a particular region and can be only assigned to deployments in the same region.
    ::::

9. Add one or more rules using IPv4, or a range of addresses with CIDR.

    ::::{note} 
    DNS names are not supported in rules.
    ::::


The next step is to [associate one or more rule-sets](../../../deploy-manage/security/ip-traffic-filtering.md#ec-associate-traffic-filter-ip-rule-set) with your deployments.


## Associate an IP filter rule set with your deployment [ec-associate-traffic-filter-ip-rule-set] 

After you’ve created the rule set, you’ll need to associate IP filter rules with your deployment:

1. Go to the deployment.
2. On the **Security** page, under **Traffic filters** select **Apply filter**.
3. Choose the filter you want to apply and select **Apply filter**.


## Remove an IP filter rule set association from your deployment [ec-remove-association-traffic-filter-ip-rule-set] 

If you want to remove any traffic restrictions from a deployment or delete a rule set, you’ll need to remove any rule set associations first. To remove an association through the UI:

1. Go to the deployment.
2. On the **Security** page, under **Traffic filters** select **Remove**.


## Edit an IP filter rule set [ec-edit-traffic-filter-ip-rule-set] 

You can edit a rule set name or change the allowed traffic sources using IPv4, or a range of addresses with CIDR.

1. Log in to the [Elasticsearch Service Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
2. Find your deployment on the home page in the Elasticsearch Service card and select **Manage** to access it directly. Or, select **Hosted deployments** to go to the deployments page to view all of your deployments.
3. Under the **Features** tab, open the **Traffic filters** page.
4. Find the rule set you want to edit.
5. Select the **Edit** icon.


## Delete an IP filter rule set [ec-delete-traffic-filter-ip-rule-set] 

If you need to remove a rule set, you must first remove any associations with deployments.

To delete a rule set with all its rules:

1. [Remove any deployment associations](../../../deploy-manage/security/ip-traffic-filtering.md#ec-remove-association-traffic-filter-ip-rule-set).
2. Under the **Features** tab, open the **Traffic filters** page.
3. Find the rule set you want to edit.
4. Select the **Delete** icon. The icon is inactive if there are deployments assigned to the rule set.
