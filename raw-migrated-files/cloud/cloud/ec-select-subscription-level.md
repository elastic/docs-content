# Choose a subscription level [ec-select-subscription-level]

When you decide to add your credit card and become a paying customer, you can choose a subscription level that includes the features you are going to use. On our [pricing page](https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service/pricing), you can get a complete list of features by subscription level.

If, at any time during your monthly subscription with Elastic Cloud, you decide you need features on a higher subscription level, you can easily make changes. You can both upgrade to a higher subscription level, or downgrade to a lower one.

To change your subscription level:

1. Log in to the [Elasticsearch Service Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
2. Select the user icon on the header bar and select **Billing** from the menu.
3. On the **Overview** page, select **Update subscription**.
4. Choose a new subscription level.
5. Save your changes.

::::{important}
Changing to a higher subscription level takes place immediately. Moving to a lower subscription level takes effect 30 days after you most recently changed to a higher subscription level; in the interim, you pay the current rate. If you havenâ€™t performed a self-service change in the past 30 days, then the change to the lower subscription level is immediate.

Customers on the prepaid consumption billing model can change their subscription level in the **Billing subscription** page. Cloud Standard is not available for customers on the prepaid consumption billing model.

## Feature usage notifications [ec_feature_usage_notifications]

If you try to change your subscription to a lower level, but you are using features that belong either to your current level or to a higher one, you need to make some changes before you can proceed, as described in **review required feature changes** link.

This overview shows you:

* Any features in use that belong to a higher subscription level, grouped by deployment
* Which subscription level you should change to in order to keep those features

You can [change your subscription level](../../../deploy-manage/cloud-organization/billing/manage-subscription.md) to the recommended level, or stop using the features that belong to a higher level. In the following list, you can find the features we are tracking and the relevant instructions to remove them from your deployments:

`Machine learning`
:   Edit your deployment to disable [machine learning](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/machine-learning/current/ml-ad-overview.html).

`Searchable snapshots`
:   Edit your deployment index management policies to disable the frozen tier that is using [searchable snapshots](../../../deploy-manage/tools/snapshot-and-restore/searchable-snapshots.md), or set up your cold tier to not mount indices from a searchable snapshot.

`JDBC/ODBC clients`
:   Make sure that there are no applications that use the SQL [JDBC](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/sql-jdbc.html) or [ODBC](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/sql-odbc.html) clients.

`Field-level or document-level security`
:   Remove any user role configurations based on field or document access [through the API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/field-and-document-access-control.html) or the Kibana Roles page.

::::{note}
After you have made your changes to the deployment, it can take up to one hour to clear the notification banner.
