# How do I resolve deployment health warnings? [ec-deployment-no-op]

The Elasticsearch Service [Deployments](https://cloud.elastic.co/deployments) page shows the current status of your active deployments. From time to time you may get one or more health warnings, such as the following:

**Seeing only one warning?**

To resolve a single health warning, we recommended first re-applying any pending changes: Select **Edit** in the deployment menu to open the Edit page and then click **Save** without making any changes. This will check all components for pending changes and will apply the changes as needed. This may impact the uptime of clusters which are not [highly available](../../../deploy-manage/production-guidance/plan-for-production-elastic-cloud.md#ec-ha).

Re-saving the deployment configuration without making any changes is often all that’s needed to resolve a transient health warning on the UI. Saving will redirect you to the Elasticsearch Service deployment [Activity page](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/keep-track-of-deployment-activity.md) where you can monitor plan completion. Repeat errors should be investigated; for more information refer to [resolving configuration change errors](../../../troubleshoot/monitoring/node-bootlooping.md).

**Seeing multiple warnings?**

If multiple health warnings appear for one of your deployments, or if your deployment is unhealthy, we recommend [Getting help](../../../troubleshoot/troubleshoot/index.md) through the Elastic Support Portal.

**Warning about system changes**

If the warning refers to a system change, check the deployment’s [Activity](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/keep-track-of-deployment-activity.md) page.
