# Sign up using an existing email address [ec-getting-started-existing-email]

Your email address is used to uniquely identify you. It can’t be used for more than one Elastic Cloud account, whether that account is a trial account, a standard Elasticsearch Service account, or a subscription account through a marketplace.

In some situations you may want to create a new Elastic Cloud account using an email address that is already associated with an existing account. For this procedure, it’s assumed that you no longer want to use the original account.

To sign up to Elastic Cloud using an email address associated with another Elastic Cloud account:

1. Use your current email address (for example, `my.preferred.address@foobar.com`) to log in to the [Elasticsearch Service Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
2. Follow the steps to [update that email address](../../../cloud-account/update-your-email-address.md) to another email address, such as `my.alternate.address@gmail.com`.

You can now use the email address from Step 1 to do the following:

* Sign up for a new account.
* [Join an existing organization](../../../deploy-manage/cloud-organization.md).

For questions or any problems, contact us at `support@elastic.co`.
