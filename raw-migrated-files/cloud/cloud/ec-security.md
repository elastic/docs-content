# Securing your deployment [ec-security]

The security of Elasticsearch Service is described on the [{{ecloud}} security](https://www.elastic.co/cloud/security) page. In addition to the security provided by {{ecloud}}, you can take the following steps to secure your deployments:

* Prevent unauthorized access with password protection and role-based access control:

    * Reset the [`elastic` user password](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/built-in-users.md).
    * Use third-party authentication providers and services like [SAML](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/saml.md), [OpenID Connect](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/openid-connect.md), or [Kerberos](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/kerberos.md) to provide dynamic [role mappings](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/mapping-users-groups-to-roles.md) for role based or attribute based access control.
    * Use {{kib}} Spaces and roles to [secure access to {{kib}}](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/quickstart.md).
    * Authorize and authenticate service accounts for {{beats}} by [granting access using API keys](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/beats-api-keys.html).
    * Roles can provide full, or read only, access to your data and can be created in Kibana or directly in Elasticsearch. Check [defining roles](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/defining-roles.md) for full details.


* Block unwanted traffic with [traffic filter](../../../deploy-manage/security/traffic-filtering.md).
* Secure your settings with the Elasticsearch [keystore](../../../deploy-manage/security/secure-settings.md).

In addition, we also enable encryption at rest (EAR) by default. Elasticsearch Service supports EAR for both the data stored in your clusters and the snapshots we take for backup, on all cloud platforms and across all regions.
