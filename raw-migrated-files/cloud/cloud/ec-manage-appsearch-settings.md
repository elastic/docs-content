# Add App Search user settings [ec-manage-appsearch-settings]

Change how App Search runs by providing your own user settings. User settings are appended to the `app-search.yml` configuration file for your instance and provide custom configuration options.

::::{tip} 
Some settings that could break your cluster if set incorrectly are blocked. Review the [list of settings](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/edit-stack-settings.md#ec-appsearch-settings) that are generally safe in cloud environments. For detailed information about App Search settings, check the [App Search documentation](https://swiftype.com/documentation/app-search/self-managed/configuration).

To add user settings:

1. Log in to the [Elasticsearch Service Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
2. Find your deployment on the home page in the Elasticsearch Service card and select **Manage** to access it directly. Or, select **Hosted deployments** to go to the deployments page to view all of your deployments.

    On the deployments page you can narrow your deployments by name, ID, or choose from several other filters. To customize your view, use a combination of filters, or change the format from a grid to a list.

3. From your deployment menu, go to the **Edit** page.
4. At the bottom of the **App Search** section, expand the **User settings overrides** caret.
5. Update the user settings.
6. Select **Save changes**.

::::{note} 
If a setting is not supported by Elasticsearch Service, you get an error message when you try to save.
