# Monitor and analyze your account usage [ec-account-usage]

Information about your current Elasticsearch Service subscription usage is available directly from the [Elasticsearch Service Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body) and includes:

* Current capacity hourly rate, for all deployments
* Usage so far this month, including data transfer and storage
* For customers with annual prepaid credits, the total value of credits to be applied in the current billing cycle

You can check the detailed usage for a selected time range grouped either by product or by deployment.

To access your account usage:

1. Log in to the [Elasticsearch Service Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
2. Open the user menu in the header bar.
3. Select **Billing** under the user menu.
4. Go to the **Usage** page.

::::{important} 
The usage breakdown information visible on the **Usage** page is an estimate, and does not include prepaid credits, free allowances or any discounts. To get the exact amount you owe for a given month, check your invoices in the [billing history](../../../deploy-manage/cloud-organization/billing/view-billing-history.md).
