# Manage traffic filtering through the API [ec-traffic-filtering-through-the-api]

This example demonstrates how to use the Elasticsearch Service RESTful API to manage different types of traffic filters. We cover the following examples:

* [Create a traffic filter rule set](../../../deploy-manage/security/manage-traffic-filtering-through-api.md#ec-create-a-traffic-filter-rule-set)

    * [IP traffic filter ingress rule set](../../../deploy-manage/security/manage-traffic-filtering-through-api.md#ec-ip-traffic-filters-ingress-rule-set)
    * [IP traffic filter egress rule set](../../../deploy-manage/security/manage-traffic-filtering-through-api.md#ec-ip-traffic-filters-egress-rule-set)
    * [AWS Privatelink traffic filters](../../../deploy-manage/security/manage-traffic-filtering-through-api.md#ec-aws-privatelink-traffic-filters-rule-set)
    * [Azure Private Link traffic filters](../../../deploy-manage/security/manage-traffic-filtering-through-api.md#ec-azure-privatelink-traffic-filters-rule-set)
    * [GCP Private Service Connect traffic filters](../../../deploy-manage/security/manage-traffic-filtering-through-api.md#ec-gcp-private-service-connect-traffic-filters-rule-set)

* [Update a traffic filter rule set](../../../deploy-manage/security/manage-traffic-filtering-through-api.md#ec-update-a-traffic-filter-rule-set)
* [Associate a rule set with a deployment](../../../deploy-manage/security/manage-traffic-filtering-through-api.md#ec-associate-rule-set-with-a-deployment)
* [Delete a rule set association with a deployment](../../../deploy-manage/security/manage-traffic-filtering-through-api.md#ec-delete-rule-set-association-with-a-deployment)
* [Delete a traffic filter rule set](../../../deploy-manage/security/manage-traffic-filtering-through-api.md#ec-delete-a-rule-set)

## Create a traffic filter rule set [ec-create-a-traffic-filter-rule-set] 


### IP traffic filter ingress rule set [ec-ip-traffic-filters-ingress-rule-set] 

Send a request like the following to create an IP traffic filter ingress rule set:

```sh
curl \
-H "Authorization: ApiKey $API_KEY" \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
https://api.elastic-cloud.com/api/v1/deployments/traffic-filter/rulesets \
-d '
{
  "name": "My IP filtering Ingress Rule Set",
  "region": "azure-japaneast",
  "description": "",
  "type": "ip",
  "rules": [
    {
      "description": "Allow inbound traffic from IP address 192.168.131.0",
      "source": "192.168.131.0"
    },
    {
      "description": "Allow inbound traffic within CIDR block 192.168.132.6/22",
      "source": "192.168.132.6/22"
    }
  ],
  "include_by_default": false
}
'
```

`region`
:   The region is always the same region as the deployment you want to associate with a traffic filter rule set. For details, check the [list of available regions](asciidocalypse://docs/cloud/docs/reference/cloud-hosted/ec-regions-templates-instances.md).

`type`
:   The type of the rule set. In the JSON object, we use `ip` for the ingress IP traffic filter. Currently, we support `ip`, `egress_firewall`, `vpce` (AWS Private Link), `azure_private_endpoint` and `gcp_private_service_connect_endpoint`. These are described in further detail below.

If the request is successful, a response containing a $RULESET_ID is returned. $RULESET_ID is required to update or delete the rule set itself, or it can be used to associate the rule set to a deployment.

```sh
{
  "id" : "5470a0010ebf437bb9294ea9fcba0ba0"
}
```


### IP traffic filter egress rule set [ec-ip-traffic-filters-egress-rule-set] 

Send a request like the following to create an IP traffic filter egress rule set:

```sh
curl \
-H "Authorization: ApiKey $API_KEY" \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
https://$COORDINATOR_HOST:12443/api/v1/deployments/traffic-filter/rulesets \
-d '
{
  "name": "My IP filtering Egress Rule Set",
  "region": "azure-japaneast",
  "description": "",
  "type": "egress_firewall",
  "rules": [
    {
       "description": "Allow outbound traffic to IP address 192.168.131.0",
       "egress_rule":
       {
           "target": "192.168.131.0",
           "protocol": "all"
       }
    },
    {
       "description": "Allow outbound traffic to CIDR block 192.168.132.6/22",
       "egress_rule":
       {
           "target": "192.168.132.6/22",
           "protocol": "all"
       }
    },
  ],
  "include_by_default": false
}
'
```

`protocol`
:   This can be `udp`, `tcp`, or `all`.


## AWS Privatelink traffic filters [ec-aws-privatelink-traffic-filters-rule-set] 

Send a request like the following to create an AWS PrivateLink traffic filter rule set:

```sh
curl -XPOST \
-H "Authorization: ApiKey $API_KEY" \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \

    {
      "source": "vpce-00000000000"
    }
  ],
  "include_by_default": false
}
'

    }
  ],
  "include_by_default": false
}
'
```

To find the value for `azure_endpoint_name` and `azure_endpoint_guid` for type `azure_private_endpoint`, check [Find your private endpoint resource name](../../../deploy-manage/security/azure-private-link-traffic-filters.md#ec-find-your-resource-name) and [Find your private endpoint resource ID](../../../deploy-manage/security/azure-private-link-traffic-filters.md#ec-find-your-resource-id).
