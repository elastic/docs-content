# Stop charges for a deployment [ec-billing-stop]

Got a deployment you no longer need and donâ€™t want to be charged for any longer? Simply delete it.

::::{important} 
**All data is lost.** Billing for usage is by the hour and any outstanding charges for usage before you deleted the deployment will still appear on your next bill.
::::


To stop being charged for a deployment:

1. Log in to the [Elasticsearch Service Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
2. Find your deployment on the home page in the Elasticsearch Service card and select **Manage** to access it directly. Or, select **Hosted deployments** to go to the deployments page to view all of your deployments.

    On the deployments page you can narrow your deployments by name, ID, or choose from several other filters. To customize your view, use a combination of filters, or change the format from a grid to a list.

3. Select **Delete deployment** and confirm the deletion.
