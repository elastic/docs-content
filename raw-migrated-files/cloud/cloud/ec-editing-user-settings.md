# Edit your user settings [ec-editing-user-settings]

From the Elasticsearch Service console you can customize Elasticsearch, Kibana, and related products to suit your needs. These editors append your changes to the appropriate YAML configuration file and they affect all users of that cluster. In each editor you can:

* [Dictate the behavior of Elasticsearch and its security features](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/edit-stack-settings.md).
* [Manage Kibanaâ€™s settings](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/edit-stack-settings.md).
* [Tune your APM Server](../../../solutions/observability/apps/configure-apm-server.md).
