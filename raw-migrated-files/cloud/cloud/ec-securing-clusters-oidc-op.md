# Set up OpenID Connect with Azure, Google, or Okta [ec-securing-clusters-oidc-op]

This page explains how to implement OIDC, from the OAuth client credentials generation to the realm configuration for Elasticsearch and Kibana, with the following OpenID Connect Providers (OPs):

* [Azure](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/openid-connect.md#ec-securing-oidc-azure)
* [Google](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/openid-connect.md#ec-securing-oidc-google)
* [Okta](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/openid-connect.md#ec-securing-oidc-okta)

For further detail about configuring OIDC, check our [list of references](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/openid-connect.md#ec-summary-and-references) at the end of this article.


## Setting up OpenID Connect with Azure [ec-securing-oidc-azure]

Follow these steps to configure OpenID Connect single sign-on on Elasticsearch Service with an Azure OP:

1. Configure the OAuth client ID:

    1. Create a new application:

        1. Sign into the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and go to **Entra** (formerly Azure Active Directory). From there, select **App registrations** > **New registration** to register a new application.

            :::{image} ../../../images/cloud-ec-oidc-new-app-azure.png
            :alt: A screenshot of the Azure Owned Applications tab on the New Registration page
            :::

        2. Enter a **Name** for your application, for example `ec-oauth2`.
        3. Select a **Supported Account Type** according to your preferences.
        4. Set the **Redirect URI** as `KIBANA_ENDPOINT_URL/api/security/oidc/callback`. You can retrieve your `KIBANA_ENDPOINT_URL` by opening the [Elasticsearch Service Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body) and selecting the Kibana **Copy endpoint** link in your deployment details.
        5. Select **Register**.
        6. Confirm that your new **Application (client) ID** appears in the app details.

    2. Create a client ID and secret:

        1. From the application that you created, go to **Certificates & secrets** and create a new secret under **Client secrets** > **New client secret**.

            :::{image} ../../../images/cloud-ec-oidc-oauth-create-credentials-azure.png
            :alt: A screenshot of the Azure Add a Client Secret dialog
            :::

        2. Provide a **Description**, for example `Kibana`.
        3. Select an expiration for the secret.
        4. Select **Add** and copy your newly created client secret for later use.

2. Add your client secret to the Elasticsearch keystore:

    1. Follow the steps described in our security settings documentation to [Add a secret value](../../../deploy-manage/security/secure-settings.md#ec-add-secret-values) to the keystore:

        1. Set the **Setting name** as `xpack.security.authc.realms.oidc.oidc1.rp.client_secret`.

            For OIDC, the client secret setting name in the keystore should be of the form: `xpack.security.authc.realms.oidc.<oidc-realm-name>.rp.client_secret`.

        2. For **Type**, select `Single string`.
        3. Paste your client secret into the **Secret** field.
        4. Select **Save**.

3. Configure Elasticsearch with the OIDC realm:

    To learn more about the available endpoints provided by Microsoft Azure, refer to the Endpoints details in the application that you configured.

    :::{image} ../../../images/cloud-ec-oidc-endpoints-azure.png
    :alt: A screenshot of the Azure Endpoints dialog with fields for Diplay Name
    :::

    To configure Elasticsearch for OIDC:

    1. Log in to the [Elasticsearch Service Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
    2. [Update your Elasticsearch user settings](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/edit-stack-settings.md) with the following configuration:

        ```sh
        xpack:
          security:
            authc:
              realms:
                oidc:
                  oidc1:
                    order: 2
                    rp.client_id: "<Application (client) ID>"
                    rp.response_type: "code"
                    rp.requested_scopes: ["openid", "email"]
                    rp.redirect_uri: "KIBANA_ENDPOINT_URL/api/security/oidc/callback"
                    op.issuer: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<Directory (tenant) ID>/v2.0"
                    op.authorization_endpoint: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<Directory (tenant) ID>/oauth2/v2.0/authorize"
                    op.token_endpoint: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<Directory (tenant) ID>/oauth2/v2.0/token"
                    op.userinfo_endpoint: "https://graph.microsoft.com/oidc/userinfo"
                    op.endsession_endpoint: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<Directory (tenant) ID>/oauth2/v2.0/logout"
                    rp.post_logout_redirect_uri: "KIBANA_ENDPOINT_URL/logged_out"
                    op.jwkset_path: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<Directory (tenant) ID>/discovery/v2.0/keys"
                    claims.principal: email
                    claim_patterns.principal: "^([^@]+)@YOUR_DOMAIN\\.TLD$"
        ```

        Where:

        * `<Application (client) ID>` is your Client ID, available in the application details on Azure.
        * `<Directory (tenant) ID>` is your Directory ID, available in the application details on Azure.
        * `KIBANA_ENDPOINT_URL` is your Kibana endpoint, available from the [Elasticsearch Service Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
        * `YOUR_DOMAIN` and `TLD` in the `claim_patterns.principal` regular expression are your organization email domain and top level domain.


    Remember to add this configuration for each node type in the [User settings](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/edit-stack-settings.md) if you use several node types based on your deployment architecture (Dedicated Master, High IO, and/or High Storage).

4. Create a role mapping:

    The following role mapping for OIDC restricts access to a specific user `(firstname.lastname)` based on the `claim_patterns.principal` email address. This prevents other users on the same domain from having access to your deployment. You can remove the rule or adjust it at your convenience.

    More details are available in our [Configuring role mappings documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/oidc-guide.html#oidc-role-mappings).

    ```json
    POST /_security/role_mapping/oidc_kibana
    {
        "enabled": true,
        "roles": [ "superuser" ],
        "rules" : {
          "all" : [
            {
              "field" : {
                "realm.name" : "oidc1"
              }
            },
            {
              "field" : {
                "username" : [
                  "<firstname.lastname>"
                ]
              }
            }
          ]
        },
        "metadata": { "version": 1 }
    }
    ```

    If you use an email in the `claim_patterns.principal`, you wonâ€™t need to add the domain in the role_mapping (for example, `firstname.lastname@your_domain.tld` should be `firstname.lastname`).

5. Configure Kibana with the OIDC realm:

    The next step is to configure Kibana, in order to initiate the OpenID authentication:

    1. Log in to the [Elasticsearch Service Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
    2. [Update your Kibana user settings](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/edit-stack-settings.md) with the following configuration:

        ```sh
        xpack.security.authc.providers:
          oidc.oidc1:
            order: 0
            realm: oidc1
            description: "Log in with Azure"
          basic.basic1:
            order: 1
        ```



## Setting up OpenID Connect with Google [ec-securing-oidc-google]

        3. Choose a **Name** for your OAuth 2 client, for example `ec-oauth2`.
        4. Add an **Authorized redirect URI**. The URI should be defined as `KIBANA_ENDPOINT_URL/api/security/oidc/callback`. You can retrieve your `KIBANA_ENDPOINT_URL` by opening the [Elasticsearch Service Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body) and selecting the Kibana **Copy endpoint** link in your deployment details.
        5. Select **Create** and copy your client ID and your client secret for later use.

2. Add your client secret to the Elasticsearch keystore:

    1. Follow the steps described in our security settings documentation to [Add a secret value](../../../deploy-manage/security/secure-settings.md#ec-add-secret-values) to the keystore:

        1. Set the **Setting name** as `xpack.security.authc.realms.oidc.oidc1.rp.client_secret`.

            For OIDC, the client secret setting name in the keystore should be of the form: `xpack.security.authc.realms.oidc.<oidc-realm-name>.rp.client_secret`.

        2. For **Type**, select `Single string`.
        3. Paste your client secret into the **Secret** field.
        4. Select **Save**.

3. Configure Elasticsearch with the OIDC realm:

    To learn more about the endpoints provided by Google, refer to this [OpenID configuration](https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration).

    To configure Elasticsearch for OIDC:

    1. Log in to the [Elasticsearch Service Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
    2. [Update your Elasticsearch user settings](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/edit-stack-settings.md) with the following configuration:

        ```sh
        xpack:
          security:
            authc:
              realms:
                oidc:
                  oidc1:
                    order: 2
                    rp.client_id: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
                    rp.response_type: "code"
                    rp.requested_scopes: ["openid", "email"]
                    rp.redirect_uri: "KIBANA_ENDPOINT_URL/api/security/oidc/callback"
                    op.issuer: "https://accounts.google.com"
                    op.authorization_endpoint: "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth"
                    op.token_endpoint: "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token"
                    op.userinfo_endpoint: "https://openidconnect.googleapis.com/v1/userinfo"
                    op.jwkset_path: "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs"
                    claims.principal: email
                    claim_patterns.principal: "^([^@]+)@YOUR_DOMAIN\\.TLD$"
        ```

        Where:

        * `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` is your Client ID.
        * `KIBANA_ENDPOINT_URL` is your Kibana endpoint, available from the [Elasticsearch Service Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
        * `YOUR_DOMAIN` and `TLD` in the `claim_patterns.principal` regular expression are your organization email domain and top level domain.


    Remember to add this configuration for each node type in the [User settings](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/edit-stack-settings.md) if you use several node types based on your deployment architecture (Dedicated Master, High IO, and/or High Storage).

4. Create a role mapping:

    The following role mapping for OIDC restricts access to a specific user `(firstname.lastname)` based on the `claim_patterns.principal` email address. This prevents other users on the same domain from having access to your deployment. You can remove the rule or adjust it at your convenience.

    More details are available in our [Configuring role mappings documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/oidc-guide.html#oidc-role-mappings).

    ```json
    POST /_security/role_mapping/oidc_kibana
    {
        "enabled": true,
        "roles": [ "superuser" ],
        "rules" : {
          "all" : [
            {
              "field" : {
                "realm.name" : "oidc1"
              }
            },
            {
              "field" : {
                "username" : [
                  "<firstname.lastname>"
                ]
              }
            }
          ]
        },
        "metadata": { "version": 1 }
    }
    ```

    If you use an email in the `claim_patterns.principal`, you wonâ€™t need to add the domain in the role_mapping (for example, `firstname.lastname@your_domain.tld` should be `firstname.lastname`).

5. Configure Kibana with the OIDC realm:

    The next step is to configure Kibana, in order to initiate the OpenID authentication:

    1. Log in to the [Elasticsearch Service Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
    2. [Update your Kibana user settings](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/edit-stack-settings.md) with the following configuration:

        ```sh
        xpack.security.authc.providers:
          oidc.oidc1:
            order: 0
            realm: oidc1
            description: "Log in with Google"
          basic.basic1:
            order: 1
        ```

        5. Set the **Login redirect URI** as `KIBANA_ENDPOINT_URL/api/security/oidc/callback`.
        6. Set the **Logout redirect URI** as `KIBANA_ENDPOINT_URL/logged_out`.
        7. Choose **Done** and copy your client ID and client secret values for later use.

2. Add your client secret to the Elasticsearch keystore:

    1. Follow the steps described in our security settings documentation to [Add a secret value](../../../deploy-manage/security/secure-settings.md#ec-add-secret-values) to the keystore:

        1. Set the **Setting name** as `xpack.security.authc.realms.oidc.oidc1.rp.client_secret`.

            For OIDC, the client secret setting name in the keystore should be of the form: `xpack.security.authc.realms.oidc.<oidc-realm-name>.rp.client_secret`.

        2. For **Type**, select `Single string`.
        3. Paste your client secret into the **Secret** field.
        4. Select **Save**.

3. Configure Elasticsearch with the OIDC realm:

    To configure Elasticsearch for OIDC:

    1. Log in to the [Elasticsearch Service Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
    2. [Update your Elasticsearch user settings](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/edit-stack-settings.md) with the following configuration:

        ```sh
        xpack:
          security:
            authc:
              realms:
                oidc:
                  oidc1:
                    order: 2
                    rp.client_id: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
                    rp.response_type: "code"
                    rp.requested_scopes: ["openid", "email"]
                    rp.redirect_uri: "KIBANA_ENDPOINT_URL/api/security/oidc/callback"
                    op.issuer: "https://YOUR_OKTA_DOMAIN"
                    op.authorization_endpoint: "https://YOUR_OKTA_DOMAIN/oauth2/v1/authorize"
                    op.token_endpoint: "https://YOUR_OKTA_DOMAIN/oauth2/v1/token"
                    op.userinfo_endpoint: "https://YOUR_OKTA_DOMAIN/oauth2/v1/userinfo"
                    op.endsession_endpoint: "https://YOUR_OKTA_DOMAIN/oauth2/v1/logout"
                    op.jwkset_path: "https://YOUR_OKTA_DOMAIN/oauth2/v1/keys"
                    claims.principal: email
                    claim_patterns.principal: "^([^@]+)@YOUR_DOMAIN\\.TLD$"
        ```

        Where:

        * `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` is the Client ID that you set up in the previous steps.
        * `KIBANA_ENDPOINT_URL` is your Kibana endpoint, available from the [Elasticsearch Service Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
        * `YOUR_OKTA_DOMAIN` is the URL of your Okta domain shown on your Okta dashboard.
        * `YOUR_DOMAIN` and `TLD` in the `claim_patterns.principal` regular expression are your organization email domain and top level domain.


    Remember to add this configuration for each node type in the [User settings](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/edit-stack-settings.md) if you use several node types based on your deployment architecture (Dedicated Master, High IO, and/or High Storage).

4. Create a role mapping:

    The following role mapping for OIDC restricts access to a specific user `(firstname.lastname)` based on the `claim_patterns.principal` email address. This prevents other users on the same domain from having access to your deployment. You can remove the rule or adjust it at your convenience.

    More details are available in our [Configuring role mappings documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/oidc-guide.html#oidc-role-mappings).

    ```json
    POST /_security/role_mapping/oidc_kibana
    {
        "enabled": true,
        "roles": [ "superuser" ],
        "rules" : {
          "all" : [
            {
              "field" : {
                "realm.name" : "oidc1"
              }
            },
            {
              "field" : {
                "username" : [
                  "<firstname.lastname>"
                ]
              }
            }
          ]
        },
        "metadata": { "version": 1 }
    }
    ```

    If you use an email in the `claim_patterns.principal`, you wonâ€™t need to add the domain in the role_mapping (for example, `firstname.lastname@your_domain.tld` should be `firstname.lastname`).

5. Configure Kibana with the OIDC realm:

    The next step is to configure Kibana, in order to initiate the OpenID authentication:

    1. Log in to the [Elasticsearch Service Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
    2. [Update your Kibana user settings](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/edit-stack-settings.md) with the following configuration:

        ```sh
        xpack.security.authc.providers:
          oidc.oidc1:
            order: 0
            realm: oidc1
            description: "Log in with Okta"
          basic.basic1:
            order: 1
        ```



## Summary and References [ec-summary-and-references]

This topic covered how to authenticate users in Kibana using OpenID Connect and different providers: Azure, Google, and Okta. If you are looking for other authentication methods, Elasticsearch Service also supports [SAML](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/saml.md) and [Kerberos](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/kerberos.md).
