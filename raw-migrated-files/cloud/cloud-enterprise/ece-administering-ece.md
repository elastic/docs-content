# Administering your installation [ece-administering-ece]

Now that you have Elastic Cloud Enterprise up and running, take a look at the things you can do to keep your installation humming along, from adding more capacity to dealing with hosts that require maintenance or have failed:

* [Scale Out Your Installation](../../../deploy-manage/maintenance/ece/scale-out-installation.md) - Need to add more capacity? Here’s how.
* [Assign Roles to Hosts](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-enterprise/assign-roles-to-hosts.md) - Make sure new hosts can be used for their intended purpose after you install ECE on them.
* [Enable Maintenance Mode](../../../deploy-manage/maintenance/ece/enable-maintenance-mode.md) - Perform administrative actions on allocators safely by putting them into maintenance mode first.
* [Move Nodes From Allocators](../../../deploy-manage/maintenance/ece/move-nodes-instances-from-allocators.md) - Moves all Elasticsearch clusters and Kibana instances to another allocator, so that the allocator is no longer used for handling user requests.
* [Delete Hosts](../../../deploy-manage/maintenance/ece/delete-ece-hosts.md) - Remove a host from your ECE installation, either because it is no longer needed or because it is faulty.
* [Perform Host Maintenance](../../../deploy-manage/maintenance/ece/perform-ece-hosts-maintenance.md) - Apply operating system patches and other maintenance to hosts safely without removing them from your ECE installation.
* [Manage Elastic Stack Versions](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-enterprise/manage-elastic-stack-versions.md) - View, add, or update versions of the Elastic Stack that are available on your ECE installation.
* [Upgrade Your Installation](../../../deploy-manage/upgrade/orchestrator/upgrade-cloud-enterprise.md) - A new version of Elastic Cloud Enterprise is available and you want to upgrade. Here’s how.
