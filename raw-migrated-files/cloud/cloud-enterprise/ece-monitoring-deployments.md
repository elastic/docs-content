# Keep your clusters healthy [ece-monitoring-deployments]

Elastic Cloud Enterprise monitors many aspects of your installation, but some issues require a human to resolve them. Use this section to learn how you can:

* [Find clusters](../../../troubleshoot/deployments/cloud-enterprise/finding-deployments-finding-problems.md) that have issues.
* [Move affected nodes off an allocator](../../../deploy-manage/maintenance/ece/move-nodes-instances-from-allocators.md), if the allocator fails.
* [Enable deployment logging and monitoring](../../../deploy-manage/monitor/stack-monitoring/ece-stack-monitoring.md) to keep an eye on the performance of deployments and debug stack and solution issues.

In addition to the monitoring of clusters that is described here, donâ€™t forget that Elastic Cloud Enterprise also provides [monitoring information for your entire installation](../../../deploy-manage/monitor/orchestrators/ece-platform-monitoring.md). You can you also monitor the physical hosts machines on which Elastic Cloud Enterprise is installed.
