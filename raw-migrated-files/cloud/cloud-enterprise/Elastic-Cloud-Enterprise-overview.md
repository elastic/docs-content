**What is ECE?**

ECE evolves from the Elastic hosted Cloud SaaS offering into a standalone product. You can deploy ECE on public or private clouds, virtual machines, or your own premises.

**Why ECE?**

* Host your regulated or sensitive data on your internal network.
* Reuse your existing investment in on-premise infrastructure and reduce total cost.
* Maximize the hardware utilization for the various clusters.
* Centralize the management of multiple Elastic deployments across teams or geographies.

**ECE features**

* All services are containerized through Docker.
* High Availability through multiple Availability Zones.
* Deployment state coordination using ZooKeeper.
* Easy access for admins through the Cloud UI and API.
* Support for off-line installations.
* Automated restore and snapshot.
