# Administering deployments [ece-administering-deployments]

Care and feeding of your deployments is important. Take a look at the things you can do to keep your deployments and the Elastic Stack running smoothly:

* [Change your deployment configuration](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-enterprise/working-with-deployments.md) to provide additional resources, for example. For many changes, your deployment can continue to handle search and indexing workloads without interruption.
* [Stop routing requests or pause nodes](../../../deploy-manage/maintenance/ece/deployments-maintenance.md) to perform corrective actions that might otherwise be difficult to complete.
* [Terminate a deployment](../../../deploy-manage/uninstall/delete-a-cloud-deployment.md) to stop all running instances and delete all data in the deployment.
* [Restart a deployment](../../../deploy-manage/maintenance/start-stop-services/restart-an-ece-deployment.md) that has become unresponsive, for example.
* [Restore a deployment](../../../deploy-manage/uninstall/delete-a-cloud-deployment.md) a deployment that had been terminated.
* [Delete a deployment](../../../deploy-manage/uninstall/delete-a-cloud-deployment.md) if you no longer need it.
* [Perform maintenance on the Kibana instance](../../../deploy-manage/maintenance.md) associated with the deployment.
* [Work with snapshots](../../../deploy-manage/tools/snapshot-and-restore.md) to recover from a failure or to recover from accidental deletion.
* [Keep your deployments healthy](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-enterprise/working-with-deployments.md) by monitoring key performance metrics.
* [Secure your clusters](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth.md) to prevent unauthorized access from unwanted traffic or users and to preserve the integrity of your data with message authentication and SSL/TLS encryption.
* [Access the Elasticsearch API console](../../../explore-analyze/query-filter/tools/console.md) - Work with the Elasticsearch RESTful API directly from the Cloud UI.
