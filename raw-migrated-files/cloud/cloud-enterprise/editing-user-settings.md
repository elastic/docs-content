# Editing your user settings [editing-user-settings]

From the Elastic Cloud Enterprise console you can customize Elasticsearch, Kibana, and other supported stack components to suit your needs. These editors append your changes to the appropriate YAML configuration file and they affect all users of that cluster. In each editor you can:

* [Dictate the behavior of Elasticsearch and its security features](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-enterprise/edit-stack-settings.md).
* [Manage Kibanaâ€™s settings](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-enterprise/edit-stack-settings.md).
* [Tune your APM Server](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-enterprise/edit-stack-settings.md).
* [Configure App Search](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-enterprise/current/ece-manage-appsearch-settings.html).
