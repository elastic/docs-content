# Restore a deployment [ece-restore-deployment]

You can restore a deployment that was previously [terminated](../../../deploy-manage/uninstall/delete-a-cloud-deployment.md) to its original configuration. Note that the data that was in the deployment is not restored, since it is deleted as part of the termination process. If you have a snapshot, you can [restore it](../../../deploy-manage/tools/snapshot-and-restore/restore-snapshot.md) to recover the Elasticsearch indices.

To restore a terminated deployment:

1. [Log into the Cloud UI](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-enterprise/log-into-cloud-ui.md).
2. On the **Deployments** page, select your deployment.

    Narrow the list by name, ID, or choose from several other filters. To further define the list, use a combination of filters.

3. In the **Deployment Management** section, select **Restore** and then acknowledge the confirmation message.
