# Restricting connections with IP filtering [ip-filtering]

You can apply IP filtering to application clients, node clients, or transport clients, remote cluster clients, in addition to other nodes that are attempting to join the cluster.

If a node’s IP address is on the denylist, the {{es}} {security-features} allow the connection to {{es}} but it is be dropped immediately and no requests are processed.

::::{note} 
Elasticsearch installations are not designed to be publicly accessible over the Internet. IP Filtering and the other capabilities of the {{es}} {security-features} do not change this condition.
::::



## Enabling IP filtering [_enabling_ip_filtering] 

The {{es}} {security-features} contain an access control feature that allows or rejects hosts, domains, or subnets. If the [{{operator-feature}}](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/operator-privileges.md) is enabled, only operator users can update these settings.

You configure IP filtering by specifying the `xpack.security.transport.filter.allow` and `xpack.security.transport.filter.deny` settings in `elasticsearch.yml`. Allow rules take precedence over the deny rules.

::::{important} 
Unless explicitly specified, `xpack.security.http.filter.*` and `xpack.security.remote_cluster.filter.*` settings default to the corresponding `xpack.security.transport.filter.*` setting’s value.
::::


```yaml
xpack.security.transport.filter.allow: "192.168.0.1"
xpack.security.transport.filter.deny: "192.168.0.0/24"
```

The `_all` keyword can be used to deny all connections that are not explicitly allowed.

```yaml
xpack.security.transport.filter.allow: [ "192.168.0.1", "192.168.0.2", "192.168.0.3", "192.168.0.4" ]
xpack.security.transport.filter.deny: _all
```

IP filtering configuration also support IPv6 addresses.

```yaml
xpack.security.transport.filter.allow: "2001:0db8:1234::/48"
xpack.security.transport.filter.deny: "1234:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334"
```

You can also filter by hostnames when DNS lookups are available.

```yaml
xpack.security.transport.filter.allow: localhost
xpack.security.transport.filter.deny: '*.google.com'
```


## Disabling IP Filtering [_disabling_ip_filtering] 

Disabling IP filtering can slightly improve performance under some conditions. To disable IP filtering entirely, set the value of the `xpack.security.transport.filter.enabled` setting in the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file to `false`.

```yaml
xpack.security.transport.filter.enabled: false
```

You can also disable IP filtering for the transport protocol but enable it for HTTP only.

```yaml
xpack.security.transport.filter.enabled: false
xpack.security.http.filter.enabled: true
```


## Specifying TCP transport profiles [_specifying_tcp_transport_profiles] 

[TCP transport profiles](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-network.html#transport-profiles) enable Elasticsearch to bind on multiple hosts. The {{es}} {security-features} enable you to apply different IP filtering on different profiles.

```yaml
xpack.security.transport.filter.allow: 172.16.0.0/24
xpack.security.transport.filter.deny: _all
transport.profiles.client.xpack.security.filter.allow: 192.168.0.0/24
transport.profiles.client.xpack.security.filter.deny: _all
```

::::{note} 
When you do not specify a profile, `default` is used automatically.
::::



## HTTP filtering [_http_filtering] 

You may want to have different IP filtering for the transport and HTTP protocols.

```yaml
xpack.security.transport.filter.allow: localhost
xpack.security.transport.filter.deny: '*.google.com'
xpack.security.http.filter.allow: 172.16.0.0/16
xpack.security.http.filter.deny: _all
```


## Remote cluster (API key based model) filtering [_remote_cluster_api_key_based_model_filtering] 

If other clusters connect [using API key authentication](../../../deploy-manage/remote-clusters/remote-clusters-api-key.md) for {{ccs}} or {{ccr}}, you may want to have different IP filtering for the remote cluster server interface.

```yaml
xpack.security.remote_cluster.filter.allow: 192.168.1.0/8
xpack.security.remote_cluster.filter.deny: 192.168.0.0/16
xpack.security.transport.filter.allow: localhost
xpack.security.transport.filter.deny: '*.google.com'
xpack.security.http.filter.allow: 172.16.0.0/16
xpack.security.http.filter.deny: _all
```

::::{note} 
Whether IP filtering for remote cluster is enabled is controlled by `xpack.security.transport.filter.enabled` as well. This means filtering for the remote cluster and transport interfaces must be enabled or disabled together. But the exact allow and deny lists can be different between them.
::::



## Dynamically updating IP filter settings [dynamic-ip-filtering] 

In case of running in an environment with highly dynamic IP addresses like cloud based hosting, it is very hard to know the IP addresses upfront when provisioning a machine. Instead of changing the configuration file and restarting the node, you can use the *Cluster Update Settings API*. For example:

```console
PUT /_cluster/settings
{
  "persistent" : {
    "xpack.security.transport.filter.allow" : "172.16.0.0/24"
  }
}
```

You can also dynamically disable filtering completely:

```console
PUT /_cluster/settings
{
  "persistent" : {
    "xpack.security.transport.filter.enabled" : false
  }
}
```

::::{note} 
In order to avoid locking yourself out of the cluster, the default bound transport address will never be denied. This means you can always SSH into a system and use curl to apply changes.
