# {{esql}} [esql]

The {{es}} Query Language ({{esql}}) provides a powerful way to filter, transform, and analyze data stored in {{es}}, and in the future in other runtimes. It is designed to be easy to learn and use, by end users, SRE teams, application developers, and administrators.

Users can author {{esql}} queries to find specific events, perform statistical analysis, and generate visualizations. It supports a wide range of commands and functions that enable users to perform various data operations, such as filtering, aggregation, time-series analysis, and more.

The {{es}} Query Language ({{esql}}) makes use of "pipes" (|) to manipulate and transform data in a step-by-step fashion. This approach allows users to compose a series of operations, where the output of one operation becomes the input for the next, enabling complex data transformations and analysis.


## The {{esql}} Compute Engine [_the_esql_compute_engine] 

{{esql}} is more than a language: it represents a significant investment in new compute capabilities within {{es}}. To achieve both the functional and performance requirements for {{esql}}, it was necessary to build an entirely new compute architecture. {{esql}} search, aggregation, and transformation functions are directly executed within Elasticsearch itself. Query expressions are not transpiled to Query DSL for execution. This approach allows {{esql}} to be extremely performant and versatile.

The new {{esql}} execution engine was designed with performance in mind â€” it operates on blocks at a time instead of per row, targets vectorization and cache locality, and embraces specialization and multi-threading. It is a separate component from the existing Elasticsearch aggregation framework with different performance characteristics.

The {{esql}} documentation is organized in these sections:
