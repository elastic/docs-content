# {{kib}} role management [kibana-role-management]

Roles are a collection of privileges that allow you to perform actions in {{kib}} and {{es}}. Users are not directly granted privileges, but are instead assigned one or more roles that describe the desired level of access. When you assign a user multiple roles, the user receives a union of the roles’ privileges. This means that you cannot reduce the privileges of a user by assigning them an additional role. You must instead remove or edit one of their existing roles.

To create a role, open the menu, then click **Stack Management > Roles** and click **Create role**.


### Required permissions [_required_permissions_7]

The `manage_security` [cluster privilege](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/elasticsearch-privileges.md#privileges-list-cluster) is required to access role management.

## Cluster privileges [adding_cluster_privileges]

Cluster privileges grant access to monitoring and management features in {{es}}. They also enable [Stack Management](../../../deploy-manage/index.md) capabilities in {{kib}}.

Refer to [cluster privileges](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/elasticsearch-privileges.md#privileges-list-cluster) for a complete description of available options.


## Index privileges [adding_index_privileges]

Each role can grant access to multiple data indices, and each index can have a different set of privileges. We recommend granting the `read` and `view_index_metadata` privileges to each index that you expect your users to work with in {{kib}}.

Refer to [index privileges](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/elasticsearch-privileges.md#privileges-list-indices) for a complete description of available options.

Document-level and field-level security affords you even more granularity when it comes to granting access to your data. With document-level security (DLS), you can write an {{es}} query to describe which documents this role grants access to. With field-level security (FLS), you can instruct {{es}} to grant or deny access to specific fields within each document.

### Example: Grant access to indices that match the `filebeat-*` pattern [index_privilege_example_1]

1. Go to **Stack Management > Roles***, and then click ***Create role**.
2. In **Index privileges**, enter:

    1. `filebeat-*` in the **Index** field.
    2. `read` and `view_index_metadata` in the **Privileges** field.

### Example: Grant read access to specific documents in indices that match the `filebeat-*` pattern [index_privilege_dls_example]

[Document-level security](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/controlling-access-at-document-field-level.md) is a [subscription feature](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions).

1. Go to **Stack Management > Roles***, and then click ***Create role**.
2. In **Index privileges**, enter:

    1. `filebeat-*` in the **Indices** field.
    2. `read` and `view_index_metadata` in the **Privileges** field.

3. Select **Grant read privileges to specific documents**.
4. Enter an {{es}} query that matches the documents your users should access. This example writes a query that allows access to documents that have a `category` field equal to `click`:

    ```sh
    {
      "match": {
        "category": "click"
      }
    }
    ```

    ::::{note}
    {{kib}} automatically surrounds your DLS query with a `query` block, so you don’t have to provide your own.

## Remote index privileges [adding_remote_index_privileges]

If you have at least a platinum license, you can manage access to indices in remote clusters.

You can assign the same privileges, document-level, and field-level as for [local index privileges](../../../deploy-manage/index.md#adding_index_privileges).

### Example: Grant access to indices in remote clusters [remote_index_privilege_example_1]

1. Go to **Stack Management > Roles***, and then click ***Create role**.
2. In **Remote index privileges**, enter:

    1. The name of your remote cluster in the **Remote clusters** field.
    2. The name of the index in your remote cluster in the **Remote indices** field.
    3. The allowed actions in the **Privileges** field. (e.g. `read` and `view_index_metadata`)

## {{kib}} privileges [adding_kibana_privileges]

To assign {{kib}} privileges to the role, click **Add {{kib}} privilege** in the {{kib}} section.

:::{image} ../../../images/kibana-spaces-roles.png
:alt: Add {{kib}} privileges
:class: screenshot
:::

Open the **Spaces*** selection control to specify whether to grant the role access to all spaces ***All Spaces*** or one or more individual spaces. If you select ***All Spaces**, you can’t select individual spaces until you clear your selection.

Use the **Privilege*** menu to grant access to features. The default is ***Custom***, which you can use to grant access to individual features. Otherwise, you can grant read and write access to all current and future features by selecting ***All***, or grant read access to all current and future features by selecting ***Read**.

When using the **Customize by feature*** option, you can choose either ***All***, ***Read*** or ***None** for access to each feature. As new features are added to {{kib}}, roles that use the custom option do not automatically get access to the new features. You must manually update the roles.

::::{note}
**{{stack-monitor-app}}** relies on built-in roles to grant access. When a user is assigned the appropriate roles, the **{{stack-monitor-app}}** application is available; otherwise, it is not visible.
::::


To apply your changes, click **Add {{kib}} privilege**. The privilege shows up under the {{kib}} privileges section of the role.

## Feature availability [_feature_availability]

Features are available to users when their roles grant access to the features, **and** those features are visible in their current space. The following matrix explains when features are available to users when controlling access via [spaces](../../../deploy-manage/manage-spaces.md#spaces-managing) and role-based access control:

| **Spaces config*** | ***Role config*** | ***Result** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Feature hidden | Feature disabled | Feature not available |
| Feature hidden | Feature enabled | Feature not available |
| Feature visible | Feature disabled | Feature not available |
| Feature visible | Feature enabled | **Feature available** |


## Assigning different privileges to different spaces [_assigning_different_privileges_to_different_spaces]

Using the same role, it’s possible to assign different privileges to different spaces. After you’ve added privileges, click **Add {{kib}} privilege***. If you’ve already added privileges for either ***All Spaces*** or an individual space, you will not be able to select these in the ***Spaces** selection control.

Additionally, if you’ve already assigned privileges at **All Spaces***, you are only able to assign additional privileges to individual spaces. Similar to the behavior of multiple roles granting the union of all privileges, {{kib}} privileges are also a union. If you’ve already granted the user the ***All*** privilege at ***All Spaces***, you’re not able to restrict the role to only the ***Read** privilege at an individual space.
