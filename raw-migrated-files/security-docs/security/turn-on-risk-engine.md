## Preview risky entities [_preview_risky_entities]

You can preview risky entities before installing the latest risk engine. The preview shows the riskiest hosts and users found in the 1000 sampled entities during the time frame selected in the date picker.

::::{note}
The preview is limited to two risk scores per {{kib}} instance.
::::


To preview risky entities, find **Entity Risk Score** in the navigation menu or by using the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).

## Turn on the latest risk engine [_turn_on_the_latest_risk_engine]

::::{note}
* To view risk score data, you must have alerts generated in your environment.
* If you previously installed the original user and host risk score modules, and you’re upgrading to {{stack}} version 8.11 or newer, refer to [Upgrade to the latest risk engine](../../../solutions/security/advanced-entity-analytics/turn-on-risk-scoring-engine.md#upgrade-risk-engine).

::::


If you’re installing the risk scoring engine for the first time:

1. Find **Entity Risk Score** in the navigation menu.
2. On the **Entity Risk Score** page, turn the toggle on.

You can also choose to include `Closed` alerts in risk scoring calculations and specify a date and time range for the calculation.

* The Entity Analytics dashboard
* The **User risk** tab on the Users page
* The **User risk** tab on a user’s details page
* The **Host risk** tab on the Hosts page
* The **Host risk** tab on a host’s details page
