# Cases [cases-overview]

Collect and share information about security issues by opening a case in {{elastic-sec}}. Cases allow you to track key investigation details, collect alerts in a central location, and more. The {{elastic-sec}} UI provides several ways to create and manage cases. Alternatively, you can use the [cases API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/kibana/group/endpoint-cases) to perform the same tasks.

You can also send cases to these external systems by [configuring external connectors](../../../solutions/security/investigate/configure-case-settings.md#cases-ui-integrations):

* {sn-itsm}
* {sn-sir}
* {{jira}} (including Jira Service Desk)
* {ibm-r}
* {swimlane}
* {webhook-cm}
