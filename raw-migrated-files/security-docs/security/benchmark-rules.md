# Benchmarks [benchmark-rules]

The Benchmarks page lets you view the cloud security posture (CSP) benchmark rules for the [Cloud security posture management](../../../solutions/security/cloud/cloud-security-posture-management.md) (CSPM) and [Kubernetes security posture management](../../../solutions/security/cloud/kubernetes-security-posture-management.md) (KSPM) integrations.

## What are benchmark rules? [_what_are_benchmark_rules_2]

Benchmark rules are used by the CSPM and KSPM integrations to identify configuration risks in your cloud infrastructure. Benchmark rules are based on the Center for Internet Security’s (CIS) [secure configuration benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/).

Each benchmark rule checks to see if a specific type of resource is configured according to a CIS Benchmark. The names of rules describe what they check, for example:

* `Ensure Kubernetes Secrets are encrypted using Customer Master Keys (CMKs) managed in AWS KMS`
* `Ensure the default namespace is not in use`
* `Ensure IAM policies that allow full "*:*" administrative privileges are not attached`
* `Ensure the default namespace is not in use`

When benchmark rules are evaluated, the resulting [findings](../../../solutions/security/cloud/findings-page-2.md) data appears on the [Cloud Security Posture dashboard](../../../solutions/security/dashboards/cloud-security-posture-dashboard.md).

Benchmark rules are not editable.

## Review your benchmarks [_review_your_benchmarks_2]

Find **Benchmarks** in the navigation menu or use the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md). From there, you can click a benchmark’s name to view the benchmark rules associated with it. You can click a benchmark rule’s name to see details including information about how to remediate it, and related links.

Benchmark rules are enabled by default, but you can disable some of them — at the benchmark level — to suit your environment. This means for example that if you have two integrations using the `CIS AWS` benchmark, disabling a rule for that benchmark affects both integrations. To enable or disable a rule, use the **Enabled** toggle on the right of the rules table.

::::{note}
Disabling a benchmark rule automatically disables any associated detection rules and alerts. Re-enabling a benchmark rule **does not** automatically re-enable them.

## How benchmark rules work [_how_benchmark_rules_work_2]

1. When a security posture management integration is deployed, and every four hours after that, {{agent}} fetches relevant cloud resources.
2. After resources are fetched, they are evaluated against all applicable enabled benchmark rules.
3. Finding values of `pass` or `fail` indicate whether the standards defined by benchmark rules were met.
