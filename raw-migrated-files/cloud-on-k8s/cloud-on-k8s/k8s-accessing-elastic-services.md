# Access Elastic Stack services [k8s-accessing-elastic-services]

To access the Elastic Stack services, you need to:

* Retrieve the `elastic` user password for basic authentication.
* Specify the IP of the service, if you want to access the service from outside the Kubernetes cluster.
* Decide if you want to use the self-signed certificate generated by ECK, or configure your own certificate.

The following sections will guide you through this process:

* [Security](../../../deploy-manage/security/secure-cluster-communications.md)
* [Services](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-on-k8s/accessing-services.md)
* [TLS certificates](../../../deploy-manage/security/secure-http-communications.md)
* [Access the Elasticsearch endpoint](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-on-k8s/accessing-services.md)
