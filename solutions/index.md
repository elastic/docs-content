# Solutions and use cases

:::{tip}
New to Elastic? Refer to [Elastic Fundamentals](/get-started/index.md) to understand the {{stack}}, its components, and your deployment options.
:::

Elastic helps you build applications for three main use cases: search, observability, and security. You can work directly with platform capabilities through APIs, use pre-built solutions with integrated UIs, or combine both approaches.

This section is organized into two parts:

- [**Search use case**](#search-use-case): Core {{es}} features accessed through APIs and client libraries, available across all [deployment types](/deploy-manage/deploy.md#choosing-your-deployment-type). Use these when you need programmatic control or the flexibility to build custom applications.
- [**Solutions and project types**](#solutions-and-project-types): Pre-built UI tools and workflows for specific use cases, available on {{serverless-full}} as project types or on other deployments as solutions. Use these to get started quickly with pre-configured workflows, sensible defaults, and tailored UI affordances.

## Search use case

The [Search use case](/solutions/search.md) documents core {{es}} search capabilities available across all Elastic [deployment types](/deploy-manage/deploy.md#choosing-your-deployment-type).

## Solutions and project types

Solutions provide integrated UI tools and workflows with sensible defaults, in addition to core platform capabilities. They help you get started quickly with common use cases.

Solutions are available as a fully managed {{serverless-short}} project, a managed service on {{ech}}, or a self-managed deployment:
- On {{serverless-full}}, you select a project type when creating your project.
- On non-serverless deployments, solution views are configured per [space](/deploy-manage/manage-spaces.md).

| Solution/Project | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [**Elasticsearch**](/solutions/elasticsearch-solution-project.md) | UI tools for building search applications |
| [**Observability**](/solutions/observability.md) | Monitor and troubleshoot applications and infrastructure |
| [**Security**](/solutions/security.md) | Protect applications and infrastructure from threats |
