# Solutions and use cases

:::{tip}
New to Elastic? Refer to [Elastic Fundamentals](/get-started/index.md) to understand the {{stack}}, its components, and your deployment options.
:::

Elastic helps you build applications for three main use cases: search, observability, and security. You can work directly with platform capabilities through APIs, use pre-built solutions with integrated UIs, or combine both approaches.

## Choose your path

| Your use case | What to use | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Building search applications | 1. [Core search capabilities](/solutions/search.md)<br><br> 2. [Elasticsearch solution](/solutions/elasticsearch-solution-project.md) | - Core {{es}} search features available across all deployment types, solutions, and project types<br><br>- Additional UI tools that complement the core search features |
| Monitoring applications or infrastructure | [Observability solution](/solutions/observability.md) | Monitor and troubleshoot with logs, metrics, and traces |
| Protecting against threats | [Security solution](/solutions/security.md) | Detect and respond to security threats |

::::{tip}
If you're not sure which solution to use, the {{es}} solution is a good starting point for general-purpose search use cases.
::::

**About solutions and project types:** Solutions are available as project types on {{serverless-full}} (select one when creating a project) or as solution views on {{ech}} and self-managed deployments (select a default solution view when creating a deployment, or configure per [space](/deploy-manage/manage-spaces.md)).
