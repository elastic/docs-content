# Solutions and use cases

:::{tip}
New to Elastic? Refer to [get started](/get-started/the-stack.md) to understand the Elastic Stack and its components, and your deployment options.
:::

Users reach for Elastic products, features, and tools for three main use cases: observability, security, and search.

These use cases are supported by ready-to-use implementations that help you get started quickly:
- As integrated solutions on [{{ech}}](/deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/cloud-hosted.md) and [self-managed](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed.md) deployments
- As project types on [{{serverless-full}}](/deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/serverless.md)

While these solutions and project types provide pre-built components for common use cases, you can also build custom implementations using Elastic's features, APIs, and tools. This documentation guides you through:

1. Evaluating if an Elastic solution fits your needs
2. Getting started with your chosen solution
3. Implementing specific features and capabilities
