# Solutions and use cases

:::{tip}
New to Elastic? Refer to [Elastic Fundamentals](/get-started/index.md) to understand the {{stack}}, its components, and your deployment options.
:::

Elastic helps you build applications for three main use cases: search, observability, and security. You can use platform-level capabilities through APIs, pre-built solutions with integrated UIs, or combine both approaches.

## Search use case

The [Search use case](/solutions/search.md) documents core {{es}} search capabilities. These capabilities work identically across all Elastic [deployment types](/deploy-manage/deploy.md#choosing-your-deployment-type) and are accessed through {{es}} APIs and client libraries. You can build custom implementations using Elastic's APIs and features without using solutions.

## Solutions and project types

Solutions are available as a fully managed Serverless project, a managed service on Elastic Cloud Hosted, or a self-managed deployment.

Solutions provide pre-built UI tools and workflows with sensible defaults for specific use cases, which build on top of the core platform capabilities. These help you get started quickly with common implementations and can be customized to meet your specific needs.

On {{serverless-full}}, you select a project type when creating your project.

On non-serverless deployments, solutions are configured in your deployment settings. 

| Solution/Project | Description | Get started |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Elasticsearch** | UI tools for building search applications | [Elasticsearch solution](/solutions/elasticsearch-solution-project.md) |
| **Observability** | Monitor and troubleshoot applications and infrastructure | [Observability solution](/solutions/observability.md) |
| **Security** | Protect applications and infrastructure from threats | [Security solution](/solutions/security.md) |
