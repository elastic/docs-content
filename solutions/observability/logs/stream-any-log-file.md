# Stream any log file

% What needs to be done: Align serverless/stateful

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/observability-docs/observability/logs-stream.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/observability-stream-log-files.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$logs-stream-agent-config$$$

$$$observability-stream-log-files-step-3-configure-the-agent$$$

$$$logs-stream-extract-agent$$$

$$$logs-stream-install-agent$$$
