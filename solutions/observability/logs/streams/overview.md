# Overview

The **Overview** tab provides key metrics for the selected stream, such as data retention, document count, storage size, and average ingestion.

- **Data retention** shows your current data retention policy. For more detailed information, visit the **Retention** [TODO - Add a link to retention] under the **Management** tab.
- **Document count** and **Storage size** show the current total amounts in your project, unrelated to the time range.
- **Ingestion** shows the average ingestion per day since the stream was created.
- The dashboard table shows quick links to dashboards [TODO: link to the dashboards page] you've attached to the stream.
