# Management

The **Management** tab provides the following ways to interact with your stream:
- [Extract field](./extract.md): Parse and extract information from log messages into dedicated fields.
- [Data retention](./retention.md): Manage how your stream retains data and get insight into data ingestion and storage size.
- [Advanced](./advanced.md): Review and manually modify the inner workings of your stream.

TODO this is very short now. There will likely be more to add here in the future, not sure if it makes sense to fill the space now
