# Configure advanced settings [streams-advanced-settings]

The **Advanced** tab shows the lower-level details of your stream. While Streams attempt to make things as easy as possible, it doesn't support every change yet. For these, you can manually interact with the index or component templates, or modify any of the other ingest pipelines that are being used.
This UI is only intended for more advanced users.
