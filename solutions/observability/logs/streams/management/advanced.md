# Configure advanced settings [streams-advanced-settings]

The **Advanced** tab shows the lower-level details of your stream. While Streams attempts to make things as easy as possible, it doesn't support every change yet. From the **Advanced** tab, you can manually interact with the index or component templates, or modify any of the other ingest pipelines that are being used.
This UI is intended for more advanced users.
