# Dashboards

The **Dashboards** tab is where you can add dashboards to your stream. Dashboards group important assets for a specific stream. Add a dashboard to your stream by selecting it from the list of available dashboards.

Added dashboards are also shown on the [**Overview** tab](./overview.md) as quick links.
