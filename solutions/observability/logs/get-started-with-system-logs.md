# Get started with system logs [observability-get-started-with-logs]

::::{note}

**For Observability Serverless projects**, the **Admin** role or higher is required to onboard log data. To learn more, refer to [Assign user roles and privileges](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cloud-organization/manage-users.md#general-assign-user-roles).

::::


In this guide you’ll learn how to onboard system log data from a machine or server, then observe the data in **Discover**.

To onboard system log data:

1. Open an [{{obs-serverless}} project](../get-started/create-an-observability-project.md) or Elastic Stack deployment.
2. From the Observability UI, go to **Add data**.
3. Under **What do you want to monitor?**, select **Host** → **Elastic Agent: Logs & Metrics**.
4. Follow the in-product steps to auto-detect your logs and install and configure the {{agent}}.

After the agent is installed and successfully streaming log data, you can view the data in the UI:

1. From the navigation menu, go to **Discover**.
1. Select **All logs** from the **Data views** menu. The view shows all log datasets. Notice you can add fields, change the view, expand a document to see details, and perform other actions to explore your data.

Now that you’ve added logs and explored your data, learn how to onboard other types of data:

* [Stream any log file](stream-any-log-file.md)
* [Get started with traces and APM](/solutions/observability/apm/get-started.md)

To onboard other types of data, select **Add Data** from the main menu.
