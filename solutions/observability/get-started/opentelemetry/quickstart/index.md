# Quickstart guides

Learn how to set up the Elastic Distributions for OpenTelemetry (EDOT) to monitor Kubernetes, applications, and hosts.

## Add data from the UI

You can quickly add data from hosts, Kubernetes, applications, and cloud services from the Observability UI.

1. Open Elastic Observability.
2. Go to **Add data**.
3. Select what you want to monitor.
4. Follow the instructions.

## Manual installation guides

The guides cover how to install the EDOT Collector, turn on auto-instrumentation, and configure data collection for metrics, logs, and traces in Elastic Observability.

Select a guide based on the environment of your target system and your Elastic deployment model.
