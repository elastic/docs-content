# Add significant events

Significant events highlight noteworthy occurrences within a streamâ€™s data. These can include events like out-of-memory errors, startup and shutdown messages, and configuration changes.

You can define significant events by either:

- **Generate significant events with AI:** If you don't know what you're looking for, let AI suggest queries based on your data. Then, select the suggestions that make sense to you.
- **Create significant events from a query:** If you know what you're looking for, write your own query to add an event.
