# Rename processor [streams-rename-processor]
% need use cases

Use the rename processor to change the name of a field, moving its value to a new field name and removing the original.

To use a rename processor:

1. Set **Source Field** to the field you want to rename.
1. Set **Target field** to the new name you want to use for the **Source Field**.

This functionality uses the {{es}} rename pipeline processor. Refer to the [rename processor](elasticsearch://reference/enrich-processor/rename-processor.md) {{es}} documentation for more information.
