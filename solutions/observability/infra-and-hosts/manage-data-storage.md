# Manage data storage [profiling-manage-storage]

Universal Profiling provides the following ways to manage how your data is stored.

* [Index lifecycle management](universal-profiling-index-life-cycle-management.md) automatically manages your indices according to age or size metric thresholds. Universal Profiling ships with a default index lifecycle policy, but you can create a custom policy to meet your requirements.
* [Probabilistic profiling](configure-probabilistic-profiling.md) mode uses representative samples of profiling data to reduce storage needs even further.
