# Step 2: Enable Universal Profiling in Kibana [profiling-self-managed-enable-kibana]

Configure {{kib}} to enable the Universal Profiling plugin with the following configuration:

```yaml
xpack.profiling.enabled: true
```

Refer to the steps for your platform to deploy update the configuration.


## ECE [_ece] 

Install the 8.12.0 stackpack or higher. Refer to [ECE manage elastic stack](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-enterprise/current/ece-manage-elastic-stack.html#ece-manage-elastic-stack) for more information.

In ECE, you don’t need to perform any additional steps to enable the Universal Profiling plugin in Kibana.


## Self-managed Elastic stack [_self_managed_elastic_stack] 

1. Edit the Kibana YAML configuration file, usually named `kibana.yml` by adding previous configuration line.
2. Restart Kibana to reload the configuration.


## Kubernetes [_kubernetes] 

If you’re using ECK, add the previous configuration line to the `kibana.k8s.elastic.co/v1` CRD, placing it under the `spec.config` key. Refer to the [ECK documentation](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-on-k8s/k8s-kibana-advanced-configuration.md#k8s-kibana-configuration) for more on configuring {{kib}}.

If you’re not using ECK, edit the `secret` or `configMap` holding the `kibana.yml` configuration file. Add the previously mentioned config line, and then perform a rolling restart of the Kibana deployment to reload the configuration.
