# Step 3: Set up Universal Profiling in Kibana [profiling-self-managed-setup-kibana]

Follow the steps in [Configure data ingestion](get-started-with-universal-profiling.md#profiling-configure-data-ingestion) to set up Universal Profiling in {{kib}}.

**If you’re running on ECE**, you can stop after setting up Universal Profiling in {{kib}}. The integrations server automatically deploys the backend applications.

**If you’re not running on ECE**, continue to [Step 4: Run the backend applications](step-4-run-backend-applications.md).
