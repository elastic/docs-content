# Monitor AWS Network Firewall logs [monitor-aws-firewall-firehose]


In this section, youâ€™ll learn how to send AWS Network Firewall log events from AWS to your Elastic stack using Amazon Data Firehose.

You will go through the following steps:

* Select a AWS Network Firewall-compatible resource
* Create a delivery stream in Amazon Data Firehose
* Set up logging to forward the logs to the Elastic stack using a Firehose stream
* Visualize your logs in {kib}


## Before you begin [firehose-firewall-prerequisites]

We assume that you already have:

* An AWS account with permissions to pull the necessary data from AWS.
* A deployment using our hosted {{ess}} on [{{ecloud}}](https://cloud.elastic.co/registration?page=docs&placement=docs-body). The deployment includes an {{es}} cluster for storing and searching your data, and {{kib}} for visualizing and managing your data. AWS Data Firehose works with Elastic Stack version 7.17 or greater, running on Elastic Cloud only.

::::{important}
AWS PrivateLink is not supported. Make sure the deployment is on AWS, because the Amazon Data Firehose delivery stream connects specifically to an endpoint that needs to be on AWS.

## Step 1: Install AWS integration in {{kib}} [firehose-firewall-step-one]

1. Find **Integrations** in the main menu or use the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).
2. Browse the catalog to find the AWS integration.
3. Navigate to the **Settings** tab and click **Install AWS assets**.


## Step 2: Select a resource [firehose-firewall-step-two]

You can either use an existing AWS Network Firewall, or create a new one for testing purposes.

Creating a Network Firewall is not trivial and is beyond the scope of this guide. For more information, check the AWS documentation on the [Getting started with AWS Network Firewall](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/getting-started.md) guide.


## Step 3: Create a stream in Amazon Data Firehose [firehose-firewall-step-three]

:::{image} ../../../images/observability-firehose-networkfirewall-stream.png
:alt: Firehose stream
:::

1. Go to the [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) and navigate to Amazon Data Firehose.
2. Click **Create Firehose stream** and choose the source and destination of your Firehose stream. Set source to `Direct PUT` and destination to `Elastic`.
3. Collect {{es}} endpoint and API key from your deployment on Elastic Cloud.

    * **To find the Elasticsearch endpoint URL**:

        1. Go to the [Elastic Cloud](https://cloud.elastic.co/) console
        2. Find your deployment in the **Hosted deployments** card and select **Manage**.
        3. Under **Applications** click **Copy endpoint** next to **Elasticsearch**.

    * **To create the API key**:

        1. Go to the [Elastic Cloud](https://cloud.elastic.co/) console
        2. Select **Open Kibana**.
        3. Expand the left-hand menu, under **Management** select **Stack management > API Keys** and click **Create API key**. If you are using an API key with **Restrict privileges**, make sure to review the Indices privileges to provide at least `auto_configure` and `write` permissions for the indices you will be using with this delivery stream.

4. Set up the delivery stream by specifying the following data:

    * Elastic endpoint URL
    * API key
    * Content encoding: gzip
    * Retry duration: 60 (default)
    * Parameter **es_datastream_name** = `logs-aws.firewall_logs-default`
    * Backup settings: failed data only to S3 bucket


::::{important}
Verify that your **Elasticsearch endpoint URL** includes `.es.` between the **deployment name** and **region**. Example: `https://my-deployment.es.us-east-1.aws.elastic-cloud.com`
::::


The Firehose stream is ready to send logs to our Elastic Cloud deployment.


## Step 4: Enable logging [firehose-firewall-step-four]

:::

The AWS Network Firewall logs have built-in logging support. It can send logs to Amazon S3, Amazon CloudWatch, and Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose.

To enable logging to Amazon Data Firehose:

1. In the AWS console, navigate to the AWS Network Firewall service.
2. Select the firewall for which you want to enable logging.
3. In the **Logging** section, click **Edit**.
4. Select the **Send logs to** option and choose **Kinesis Data Firehose**.
5. Select the Firehose stream you created in the previous step.
6. Click **Save**.

At this point, the Network Firewall will start sending logs to the Firehose stream.


## Step 5: Visualize your Network Firewall logs in {{kib}} [firehose-firewall-step-five]

:::

With the new logging settings in place, the Network Firewall starts sending log events to the Firehose stream.

Navigate to {{kib}} and choose **Visualize your logs with Discover**.
