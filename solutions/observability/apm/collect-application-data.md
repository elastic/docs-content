# Collect application data [apm-collect-application-data]

::::{note}
**For Observability Serverless projects**, the **Admin** role or higher is required to send APM data to Elastic. To learn more, refer to [Assign user roles and privileges](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cloud-organization/user-roles.md#general-assign-user-roles).

## Language-specific options [_language_specific_options]

Use Elastic APM agents or an OpenTelemetry language SDK to instrument a service in the language its written in:

* [**OpenTelemetry**](/solutions/observability/apm/use-opentelemetry-with-apm.md): OpenTelemetry is an open source set of APIs, SDKs, tooling, and integrations that enable the capture and management of telemetry data from your services and applications. Elastic offers [Elastic Distributions of OpenTelemetry (EDOT)](opentelemetry://reference/edot-sdks/index.md), which are customized versions of [OpenTelemetry language SDKs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/) that are optimized to work with an Elastic backend.
* [**Elastic APM agents**](/solutions/observability/apm/elastic-apm-agents.md): Elastic APM agents are instrumentation libraries written in the same language as your service.

## Service-specific options [_service_specific_options]

Elastic also offers several tools to help you collect data from specific services:

* **Kubernetes**: The Elastic APM attacher for Kubernetes simplifies the instrumentation and configuration of your application pods. Read more in the [APM attacher for Kubernetes docs](apm-k8s-attacher://reference/index.md).
* **AWS Lambda Functions**: Helps you monitor your AWS Lambda functions. Read more in the [APM Architecture for AWS Lambda docs](apm-aws-lambda://reference/index.md).
* **Jaeger (deprecated)**: Helps you to switch an existing Jaeger setup from the default Jaeger backend to the {{stack}}. Read more in [Integrate with Jaeger](/solutions/observability/apm/jaeger.md).
