# APM Server advanced setup [apm-setting-up-and-running]

Before reading this section, refer to [](/solutions/observability/apm/apm-server/setup.md) for basic installation and running instructions.

:::{note}
This section covers APM Server setup. As an alternative, you can use the [Elastic Distribution of OpenTelemetry (EDOT) Collector](opentelemetry://reference/index.md) to collect application telemetry data using OpenTelemetry. For mobile applications, you can use the [EDOT Android SDK](apm-agent-android://reference/edot-android/index.md) or [EDOT iOS SDK](apm-agent-ios://reference/edot-ios/index.md).
