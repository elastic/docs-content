# SSL/TLS settings [apm-configuration-ssl-landing]

SSL/TLS is available for:

* [APM Server **outputs**](/solutions/observability/apm/ssl-tls-output-settings.md) that support SSL, like {{es}}, {{ls}}, or Kafka.

Additional information on getting started with SSL/TLS is available in [Use APM securely](/solutions/observability/apm/use-apm-securely.md).
