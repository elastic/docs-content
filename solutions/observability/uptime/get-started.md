# Get started with Uptime [uptime-get-started]

::::{admonition} Deprecated in 8.15.0.
:class: warning

Use [Synthetic monitoring](/solutions/observability/synthetics/index.md) instead of the {{uptime-app}}.
::::

::::{important}
**This approach can only be used to create lightweight monitors.** To create *browser* monitors, use the [{{synthetics-app}}](/solutions/observability/synthetics/get-started.md).
::::

{{heartbeat}} is a lightweight daemon that you install on a remote server to periodically check the status of your services and determine if they are available. It gathers performance data, formats it, and sends the data to the {{stack}}.

:alt: Diagram showing which pieces of software are used to configure monitors
:::

::::{note}
The Elastic Synthetics integration is a method for creating synthetic monitors that is no longer recommended. **Do not use the Elastic Synthetics integration to set up new monitors.**

For details on how to migrate from Elastic Synthetics integration to {{project-monitors}} or the {{synthetics-app}}, refer to [Migrate from the Elastic Synthetics integration](/solutions/observability/synthetics/migrate-from-elastic-synthetics-integration.md).

If you’ve used the Elastic Synthetics integration to create monitors in the past and need to reference documentation about the integration, go to the [8.3 documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/observability/8.3/uptime-set-up.html#uptime-set-up-choose-agent).

::::

## Pull the Docker image [uptime-set-up-docker]

Elastic provides Docker images that you can use to run monitors. Start by pulling the {{heartbeat}} Docker image.

```sh subs=true
docker pull docker.elastic.co/beats/heartbeat:{{version}}
```

## Configure [uptime-set-up-config]

Next, create a `heartbeat.yml` configuration file.

The example below shows how to configure an `http` monitor, one of [three types of lightweight monitors](beats://reference/heartbeat/configuration-heartbeat-options.md#monitor-types).

```yaml
heartbeat.monitors:
- type: http
  id: service-status <1>
  name: Service Status
  service.name: my-apm-service-name
  hosts: ["http://localhost:80/service/status"]
  check.response.status: [200]
  schedule: '@every 5s'
```

1. Each `monitor` gets its own ID in the {{uptime-app}} and its own schedule entry. This allows tests to be run in parallel and analyzed separately.

Read more about configuration options in [Configure {{heartbeat}} monitors](beats://reference/heartbeat/configuration-heartbeat-options.md).

::::{warning}
**Do not use {{heartbeat}} to set up a *new* `browser` monitor.** Instead, use the [{{synthetics-app}}](/solutions/observability/synthetics/get-started.md).

If you previously used {{heartbeat}} to set up **`browser`** monitor, you can find resources in the [8.4 {{heartbeat}} documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/heartbeat/8.4/monitor-browser-options.html).

::::

## Connect to the {{stack}} [uptime-set-up-connect]

After configuring the monitor, run it in Docker and connect the monitor to the {{stack}}.

You'll need to retrieve your {{es}} credentials for either an [{{ecloud}} ID](beats://reference/heartbeat/configure-cloud-id.md) or another [{{es}} Cluster](beats://reference/heartbeat/elasticsearch-output.md).

The example below, shows how to run synthetics tests indexing data into {{es}}.
You'll need to insert your actual `cloud.id` and `cloud.auth` values to successfully index data to your cluster.

% We do NOT use <1> references in the below example, because they create whitespace after the trailing \
% when copied into a shell, which creates mysterious errors when copy and pasting!

```sh subs=true
docker run \
  --rm \
  --name=heartbeat \
  --user=heartbeat \
  --volume="$PWD/heartbeat.yml:/usr/share/heartbeat/heartbeat.yml:ro" \
  --cap-add=NET_RAW \
  docker.elastic.co/beats/heartbeat:{{version}} heartbeat -e \
  -E cloud.id={cloud-id} \
  -E cloud.auth=elastic:{cloud-pass}
```

If you aren't using {{ecloud}}, replace `-E cloud.id` and `-E cloud.auth` with your {{es}} hosts,
username, and password:

```sh subs=true
docker run \
  --rm \
  --name=heartbeat \
  --user=heartbeat \
  --volume="$PWD/heartbeat.yml:/usr/share/heartbeat/heartbeat.yml:ro" \
  --cap-add=NET_RAW \
  docker.elastic.co/beats/heartbeat:{{version}} heartbeat -e \
  -E output.elasticsearch.hosts=["localhost:9200"] \
  -E output.elasticsearch.username=elastic \
  -E output.elasticsearch.password=changeme
```

Note the `--volume` option, which mounts local directories into the
container. Here, we mount the `heartbeat.yml` from the working directory,
into {{heartbeat}}'s expected location for `heartbeat.yml`.

:::{warning}
Elastic Synthetics runs Chromium without the extra protection of its process
[sandbox](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/linux/sandboxing.md)
for greater compatibility with Linux server distributions.
Add the `sandbox: true` option to a given browser monitor in {{heartbeat}} to enable sandboxing.
This may require using a custom seccomp policy with docker, which brings its own added risks.
This is generally safe when run against sites whose content you trust,
and with a recent version of Elastic Synthetics and Chromium.
:::

## View in {{kib}} [uptime-set-up-kibana]

{{heartbeat}} is now sending synthetic monitoring data to the {{stack}}. Navigate to the {{uptime-app}} in {{kib}}, where you can see screenshots of each run, set up alerts in case of test failures, and more.

If a test does fail (shown as `down` in the {{uptime-app}}), you’ll be able to view the step script that failed, any errors, and a stack trace. For more information, refer to [Analyze](/solutions/observability/uptime/analyze.md).

## Manage monitors [uptime-manage]

After you’ve created a monitor, you’ll need to manage that monitor over time. This might include updating or permanently deleting an existing monitor.

To update a monitor’s configuration, update the relevant options in the {{heartbeat}} configuration file, and the changes will be reflected in the monitors.

To permanently delete a monitor, delete the monitor entry in the `heartbeat.yml` file.
