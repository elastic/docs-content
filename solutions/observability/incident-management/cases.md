# Cases for Elastic {{observability}} [observability-cases]

Collect and share information about observability issues by creating a case. Cases allow you to track key investigation details, add assignees and tags to your cases, set their severity and status, and add alerts, comments, and visualizations. You can also send cases to third-party systems by [configuring external connectors](/solutions/observability/incident-management/configure-case-settings.md).

{applies_to}`stack: ga 9.2` Cases are automatically assigned human-readable numeric IDs, which you can use for easier referencing. Each time you create a new case in your [space](docs-content://deploy-manage/manage-spaces.md), the case ID increments by one. You can find the ID after the case's name and can use it while searching the Cases table.
