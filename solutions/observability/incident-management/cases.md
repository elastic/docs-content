# Cases for Elastic {{observability}} [observability-cases]

Cases are a collaboration and tracking tool, which is particularly useful for incidents or issues that arise from alerts. You can group related alerts into a case for easier management, add notes and comments to provide context, track investigation progress, and assign cases to team members or link them to external systems. Cases ensure that teams have a central place to track and resolve alerts efficiently.
