# Create an uptime duration anomaly rule [duration-anomaly-alert]

::::{admonition} Deprecated in 8.15.0.
:class: warning

Use [Synthetic monitoring](/solutions/observability/synthetics/index.md) instead of the {{uptime-app}}.
::::

Within the {{uptime-app}}, create an **Uptime duration anomaly** rule to receive notifications based on the response durations for all of the geographic locations of each monitor. When a monitor runs for an unusual amount of time, at a particular time, an anomaly is recorded and highlighted on the [Monitor duration](/solutions/observability/uptime/inspect-duration-anomalies.md) chart.


## Conditions [duration-alert-conditions]

For each rule, you can configure which severity level triggers the alert. The default level is `critical`.

The *anomaly score* is a value from `0` to `100`, which indicates the significance of the anomaly compared to previously seen anomalies. The highly anomalous values are shown in red and the low scored values are indicated in blue.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **warning** | Score `0` and above. |
| **minor** | Score `25` and above. |
| **major** | Score `50` and above. |
| **critical** | Score `75` and above. |

## Action types [action-types-duration]

Extend your rules by connecting them to actions that use the following supported built-in integrations. Actions are {{kib}} services or integrations with third-party systems that run as background tasks on the {{kib}} server when rule conditions are met.

You can configure action types on the [Settings](/solutions/observability/uptime/configure-settings.md#configure-uptime-alert-connectors) page.

::::{note}
Some connector types are paid commercial features, while others are free. For a comparison of the Elastic subscription levels, go to [the subscription page](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions).

::::


After you select a connector, you must set the action frequency. You can choose to create a summary of alerts on each check interval or on a custom interval. For example, send email notifications that summarize the new, ongoing, and recovered alerts every twelve hours:

:::

Alternatively, you can set the action frequency such that you choose how often the action runs (for example, at each check interval, only when the alert status changes, or at a custom action interval). In this case, you must also select the specific threshold condition that affects when actions run: `Uptime Duration Anomaly` or `Recovered`.

## Action variables [action-variables-duration]

Use the default notification message or customize it. You can add more context to the message by clicking the icon above the message text box and selecting from a list of available variables.

## Alert recovery [recovery-variables-duration]

To receive a notification when the alert recovers, select **Run when Recovered**. Use the default notification message or customize it. You can add more context to the message by clicking the icon above the message text box and selecting from a list of available variables.
