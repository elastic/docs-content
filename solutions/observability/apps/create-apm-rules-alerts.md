# Create APM rules and alerts

% What needs to be done: Align serverless/stateful

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/observability-docs/observability/apm-alerts.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/observability-apm-alerts.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$apm-alert-view-group$$$
