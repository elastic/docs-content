% What needs to be done: Align serverless/stateful

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/observability-apm-reduce-your-data-usage.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$observability-apm-reduce-stacktrace$$$

$$$apm-reduce-sample-rate$$$
