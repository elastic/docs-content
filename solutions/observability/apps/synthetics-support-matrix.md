# Synthetics support matrix [synthetics-support-matrix]

There are various components that make up the Synthetics solution, which are supported in the following configurations:


## {{synthetics-app}} [_synthetics_app] 

* **GA support**: 8.8.0 and higher
* **Notes**:

    * For creating and managing lightweight and browser monitors configured through the [{{synthetics-app}}](create-monitors-in-synthetics-app.md)
    * For reporting for lightweight and browser monitors configured through the [{{synthetics-app}}](create-monitors-in-synthetics-app.md) and/or [{{project-monitors-cap}}](create-monitors-with-project-monitors.md)



## {{project-monitors-cap}} [_project_monitors_cap] 

* **GA support**: 8.8.0 and higher
* **Notes**: For creating and managing lightweight and browser monitors configured as [{{project-monitors-cap}}](create-monitors-with-project-monitors.md)


## Elastic’s global managed testing infrastructure [_elastics_global_managed_testing_infrastructure_2] 

* **GA support**: 8.8.0 and higher
* **Notes**: Elastic’s infrastructure for running lightweight and browser monitors configured through the [{{synthetics-app}}](create-monitors-in-synthetics-app.md) and/or [{{project-monitors-cap}}](create-monitors-with-project-monitors.md)

    Executing synthetic tests on Elastic’s global managed testing infrastructure incurs an additional charge. Tests are charged under one of two new billing dimensions depending on the monitor type. For *browser monitor* usage, there is a fee per test run. For *lightweight monitor* usage, there is a fee per region in which you run any monitors regardless of the number of test runs. For more details, refer to [full details and current pricing](https://www.elastic.co/pricing).



## {{private-location}}s [_private_locations_2] 

* **GA support**: 8.8.0 and higher
* **Notes**:

    * For running lightweight and browser monitors from your self-managed infrastructure
    * Relies on the Synthetics integration 1.0.0 or above

        * Any *inline* or *Zip URL* monitors configured with the beta Synthetics integration prior to 1.0.0, are not supported and will stop running in the future

    * Shipped as the `elastic-agent-complete` Docker image
    * Must have a direct connection to {{es}}

        * Do not configure any ingest pipelines or Logstash output



## Heartbeat with Uptime [_heartbeat_with_uptime] 

* **GA support**: As defined in the standard [Support matrix](https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix)
* **Notes**:

    * For running lightweight monitors via YML configuration running on self-managed infrastructure
    * Browser-based monitors are not supported in this configuration



## Standalone {{agent}} [_standalone_agent] 

* **GA support**: As defined in the standard [Support matrix](https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix)
* **Notes**:

    * For running lightweight monitors via YML configuration running on self-managed infrastructure with standalone {{agent}}
    * Browser-based monitors are not supported in this configuration
    * Results for monitors configured using the standalone {{agent}} are available in the {{uptime-app}} (*not* the {{synthetics-app}})



## Synthetics Recorder [_synthetics_recorder] 

System requirements:

* macOS - High Sierra and newer
* Windows - Windows 10 and newer
* Linux:

    * Ubuntu - 14.04 and newer
    * Fedora - 24 and newer
    * Debian - 8 and newer



## Output to Elasticsearch [_output_to_elasticsearch] 

Synthetics must have a direct connection to {{es}}, whether running monitors from Elastic’s global managed testing infrastructure or from {{private-location}}s.

Do not configure any ingest pipelines or output via Logstash as this will prevent Synthetics from working properly and is not supported.
