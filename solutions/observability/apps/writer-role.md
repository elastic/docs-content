# Writer role [synthetics-role-write]

::::{important} 
To minimize the privileges required by the writer role, use the [setup role](setup-role.md) to enable Monitor Management. This section assumes another user has already enabled Monitor Management.
::::


For users who need to create, modify, and delete monitors, provide write access. Two types of write access are outlined below:

* **General write access**: For most users, you can use [General write access](#synthetics-write-privileges-general), which grants write access to all {{kib}} apps and requires little configuration.
* **Limited write access**: If you want to limit write access to the {{synthetics-app}} only, you can use [Limited write access](#synthetics-write-privileges-limited), which requires additional configuration.


## General write access [synthetics-write-privileges-general] 

Create a **writer role**, called something like `synthetics_writer`:

1. Start with the `editor` [built-in role](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/built-in-roles.md). This role grants full access to all features in {{kib}} (including the {{observability}} solution) and read-only access to data indices.

    ::::{note} 
    The `editor` [built-in role](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/built-in-roles.md) will grant write access to *all* {{kib}} apps. If you want to limit write access to the {{synthetics-app}} only, refer to [Limited write access](#synthetics-write-privileges-limited).
    ::::

2. *If the user should have permission to create, modify, and delete project monitors*, they will need an API key that can be used to `push` monitors. To create API keys, the user will also need *at least one* of the following privileges in addition to the privileges included in the `editor` built-in role:

    | Type | Privilege | Purpose |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | [Cluster](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/elasticsearch-privileges.md#privileges-list-cluster) | `manage_own_api_key` | Allows access to all security-related operations on {{es}} API keys that are owned by the current authenticated user. |
    | [Cluster](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/elasticsearch-privileges.md#privileges-list-cluster) | `manage_security` | Allows access to all security-related operations such as CRUD operations on users and roles and cache clearing. |
    | [Cluster](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/elasticsearch-privileges.md#privileges-list-cluster) | `manage_api_key` | Allows access to all security-related operations on {{es}} API keys. |



## Limited write access [synthetics-write-privileges-limited] 

If you want to limit write access to the {{synthetics-app}} only, do *not* use the `editor` [built-in role](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/built-in-roles.md).

Instead to you can create a writer role, called something like `synthetics_writer_limited`, and start by granting the following privileges:

| Type | Privilege | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Index](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/elasticsearch-privileges.md#privileges-list-indices) | `synthetics-*`: `read` | Read-only access to synthetics indices. |
| [Index](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/elasticsearch-privileges.md#privileges-list-indices) | `.alerts-observability.uptime.alerts-*`: `read` | Read-only access to synthetics alert indices. |
| [Kibana](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/kibana-privileges.md) | `Synthetics and Uptime`: `All` | Access to the {{synthetics-app}} in {{kib}}. |

Additional privileges will depend on the factors below.


### To restrict using Elastic’s global managed infrastructure [disable-managed-locations] 

To restrict users assigned this role from using monitors hosted on Elastic’s global managed infrastructure:

1. Expand `Synthetics and Uptime` in the list of [Kibana](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/kibana-privileges.md) privileges.
2. Toggle *Customize sub-feature privileges*.
3. Uncheck *Elastic managed locations enabled*.


### If using Private Locations [synthetics-role-write-private-locations] 

The user who initially sets up a new Private Location needs additional privileges. Users who create or update monitors hosted on that Private Location do not need any additional permissions.

The user who is setting up a new Private Location will need the following privileges when creating the agent policy in {{fleet}}:

| Type | Privilege | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Kibana](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/kibana-privileges.md) | `Fleet`: `All` | Access to Fleet in {{kib}}. |
| [Kibana](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/kibana-privileges.md) | `Integrations`: `read` | Access to Integrations in {{kib}}. |


### If using projects [_if_using_projects] 

If the user should be able to create and update monitors using [projects](get-started.md#choose-projects), add *at least one* of following privileges:

| Type | Privilege | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Cluster](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/elasticsearch-privileges.md#privileges-list-cluster) | `manage_own_api_key` | Allows access to all security-related operations on {{es}} API keys that are owned by the current authenticated user. |
| [Cluster](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/elasticsearch-privileges.md#privileges-list-cluster) | `manage_security` | Allows access to all security-related operations such as CRUD operations on users and roles and cache clearing. |
| [Cluster](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/elasticsearch-privileges.md#privileges-list-cluster) | `manage_api_key` | Allows access to all security-related operations on {{es}} API keys. |
