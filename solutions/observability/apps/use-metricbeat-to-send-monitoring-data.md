# Use Metricbeat to send monitoring data [apm-monitoring-metricbeat-collection]


In 7.3 and later, you can use {{metricbeat}} to collect data about APM Server and ship it to the monitoring cluster. The benefit of using {{metricbeat}} instead of internal collection is that the monitoring agent remains active even if the APM Server instance dies.

To collect and ship monitoring data:

1. [Configure the shipper you want to monitor](#apm-configure-shipper)
2. [Install and configure {{metricbeat}} to collect monitoring data](#apm-configure-metricbeat)


## Configure the shipper you want to monitor [apm-configure-shipper] 

1. Enable the HTTP endpoint to allow external collection of monitoring data:

    Add the following setting in the APM Server configuration file (`apm-server.yml`):

    ```yaml
    http.enabled: true
    ```

    By default, metrics are exposed on port 5066. If you need to monitor multiple {{beats}} shippers running on the same server, set `http.port` to expose metrics for each shipper on a different port number:

    ```yaml
    http.port: 5067
    ```

2. Disable the default collection of APM Server monitoring metrics.<br>

    Add the following setting in the APM Server configuration file (`apm-server.yml`):

    ```yaml
    monitoring.enabled: false
    ```

    For more information, see [Monitoring configuration options](use-internal-collection-to-send-monitoring-data.md#apm-configuration-monitor).

3. Configure host (optional).<br>

    If you intend to get metrics using {{metricbeat}} installed on another server, you need to bind the APM Server to host’s IP:

    ```yaml
    http.host: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
    ```

4. Configure cluster UUID (optional).<br>

    To see the {{beats}} monitoring section in {{kib}} if you have a cluster, you need to associate the APM Server with cluster UUID:

    ```yaml
    monitoring.cluster_uuid: "cluster-uuid"
    ```

5. Start APM Server.


## Install and configure {{metricbeat}} to collect monitoring data [apm-configure-metricbeat] 

1. Install {{metricbeat}} on the same server as APM Server. To learn how, see [Get started with {{metricbeat}}](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/current/metricbeat-installation-configuration.html). If you already have {{metricbeat}} installed on the server, skip this step.
2. Enable the `beat-xpack` module in {{metricbeat}}.<br>

    For example, to enable the default configuration in the `modules.d` directory, run the following command, using the correct command syntax for your OS:

    ```sh
    metricbeat modules enable beat-xpack
    ```

    For more information, see [Configure modules](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/current/configuration-metricbeat.html) and [beat module](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/current/metricbeat-module-beat.html).

3. Configure the `beat-xpack` module in {{metricbeat}}.<br>

    The `modules.d/beat-xpack.yml` file contains the following settings:

    ```yaml
    - module: beat
      metricsets:
        - stats
        - state
      period: 10s
      hosts: ["http://localhost:5066"]
      #username: "user"
      #password: "secret"
      xpack.enabled: true
    ```

    Set the `hosts`, `username`, and `password` settings as required by your environment. For other module settings, it’s recommended that you accept the defaults.

    By default, the module collects APM Server monitoring data from `localhost:5066`. If you exposed the metrics on a different host or port when you enabled the HTTP endpoint, update the `hosts` setting.

    To monitor multiple APM Server instances, specify a list of hosts, for example:

    ```yaml
    hosts: ["http://localhost:5066","http://localhost:5067","http://localhost:5068"]
    ```

    If you configured APM Server to use encrypted communications, you must access it via HTTPS. For example, use a `hosts` setting like `https://localhost:5066`.

    If the Elastic {{security-features}} are enabled, you must also provide a user ID and password so that {{metricbeat}} can collect metrics successfully:

    1. Create a user on the {{es}} cluster that has the `remote_monitoring_collector` [built-in role](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/built-in-roles.md). Alternatively, if it’s available in your environment, use the `remote_monitoring_user` [built-in user](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/built-in-users.md).
    2. Add the `username` and `password` settings to the beat module configuration file.

4. Optional: Disable the system module in the {{metricbeat}}.

    By default, the [system module](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/current/metricbeat-module-system.html) is enabled. The information it collects, however, is not shown on the **{{stack-monitor-app}}** page in {{kib}}. Unless you want to use that information for other purposes, run the following command:

    ```sh
    metricbeat modules disable system
    ```

5. Identify where to send the monitoring data.<br>

    ::::{tip} 
    In production environments, we strongly recommend using a separate cluster (referred to as the *monitoring cluster*) to store the data. Using a separate monitoring cluster prevents production cluster outages from impacting your ability to access your monitoring data. It also prevents monitoring activities from impacting the performance of your production cluster.
    ::::


    For example, specify the {{es}} output information in the {{metricbeat}} configuration file (`metricbeat.yml`):

    ```yaml
    output.elasticsearch:
      # Array of hosts to connect to.
      hosts: ["http://es-mon-1:9200", "http://es-mon2:9200"] <1>

      # Optional protocol and basic auth credentials.
      #protocol: "https"
      #api_key:  "id:api_key" <2>
      #username: "elastic"
      #password: "changeme"
    ```

    1. In this example, the data is stored on a monitoring cluster with nodes `es-mon-1` and `es-mon-2`.
    2. Specify one of `api_key` or `username`/`password`.


    If you configured the monitoring cluster to use encrypted communications, you must access it via HTTPS. For example, use a `hosts` setting like `https://es-mon-1:9200`.

    ::::{important} 
    The {{es}} {monitor-features} use ingest pipelines, therefore the cluster that stores the monitoring data must have at least one ingest node.
    ::::


    If the {{es}} {security-features} are enabled on the monitoring cluster, you must provide a valid user ID and password so that {{metricbeat}} can send metrics successfully:

    1. Create a user on the monitoring cluster that has the `remote_monitoring_agent` [built-in role](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/built-in-roles.md). Alternatively, if it’s available in your environment, use the `remote_monitoring_user` [built-in user](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/built-in-users.md).

        ::::{tip} 
        If you’re using {{ilm}}, the remote monitoring user requires additional privileges to create and read indices. For more information, see [Use feature roles](create-assign-feature-roles-to-apm-server-users.md).
        ::::

    2. Add the `username` and `password` settings to the {{es}} output information in the {{metricbeat}} configuration file.

    For more information about these configuration options, see [Configure the {{es}} output](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/current/elasticsearch-output.html).

6. [Start {{metricbeat}}](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/current/metricbeat-starting.html) to begin collecting monitoring data.
7. [View the monitoring data in {{kib}}](../../../deploy-manage/monitor/stack-monitoring/kibana-monitoring-data.md).
