# Upgrade to version 8.x [apm-upgrading-to-8.x]

This guide explains the upgrade process for version 9.0.0-beta1. For a detailed look at what’s new, see:

* [What’s new in {{observability}}](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/observability/current/whats-new.html)
* [What’s new in {{kib}}](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/whats-new.html)
* [{{es}} release highlights](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/release-highlights.html)


## Notable APM changes [_notable_apm_changes]

* All index management has been removed from APM Server; the built-in {{es}} apm-data plugin is entirely responsible for setting up index templates, index lifecycle polices, and index pipelines.
* APM Server now only writes to well-defined data streams; writing to classic indices is no longer supported.
* APM Server has a new {{es}} output implementation with defaults that should be sufficient for most use cases.

As a result of the above changes, a number of index management and index tuning configuration variables have been removed. See the APM [release notes](asciidocalypse://docs/docs-content/docs/release-notes/apm.md), [breaking changes](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/observability/current/apm-breaking.html) for full details.
