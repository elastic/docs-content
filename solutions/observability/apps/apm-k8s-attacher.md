# APM K8S Attacher [apm-k8s-attacher]


The [APM attacher for Kubernetes](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/attacher/current/apm-attacher.html) simplifies the instrumentation and configuration of your application pods. The attacher includes a webhook receiver that modifies pods so they are automatically instrumented by an Elastic APM agent.

Ready to get started? See [Instrument and configure pods](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/attacher/current/apm-get-started-webhook.html) to get started.
