# APM K8S Attacher [apm-k8s-attacher]


The [APM attacher for Kubernetes](asciidocalypse://docs/apm-k8s-attacher/docs/reference/ingestion-tools/apm-attacher/index.md) simplifies the instrumentation and configuration of your application pods. The attacher includes a webhook receiver that modifies pods so they are automatically instrumented by an Elastic APM agent.

Ready to get started? See [Instrument and configure pods](asciidocalypse://docs/apm-k8s-attacher/docs/reference/ingestion-tools/apm-attacher/apm-get-started-webhook.md) to get started.
