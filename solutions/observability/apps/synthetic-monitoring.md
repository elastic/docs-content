# Synthetic monitoring

% What needs to be done: Align serverless/stateful

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/observability-docs/observability/monitor-uptime-synthetics.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/observability-monitor-synthetics.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$monitoring-uptime$$$

$$$monitoring-synthetics$$$

$$$observability-monitor-synthetics-browser-monitors$$$

$$$observability-monitor-synthetics-lightweight-https-tcp-and-icmp-monitors$$$
