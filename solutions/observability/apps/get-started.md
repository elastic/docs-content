% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/observability-docs/observability/synthetics-get-started.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/observability-synthetics-get-started.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$choose-projects$$$

$$$observability-synthetics-get-started-synthetics-project$$$
