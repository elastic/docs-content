# Mobile service overview [apm-mobile-service-overview]

Selecting a mobile service brings you to the **Mobile service overview**. The **Mobile service overview** contains a wide variety of charts and tables that provide high-level visibility into how a mobile service is performing for your users—​enabling you to make data-driven decisions about how to improve your user experience.

For example, see:

* Crash Rate (Crashes per session)
* Slowest App load time — coming soon
* Number of sessions
* Number of HTTP requests
* Map showing the total number of HTTP requests based on country and region
* Most used devices, network connection type, OS version, and app version
* Latency, throughput, and errors over time
* Service dependencies

All of these metrics & insights can help SREs and developers better understand the health of their mobile application environment and the impact of backend errors and bottlenecks on end-user experience.


## Quick stats [mobile-service-stats]

Understand the impact of slow application load times and variations in application crash rate on user traffic (coming soon). Visualize session and HTTP trends, and see where your users are located—​enabling you to optimize your infrastructure deployment and routing topology.

Note: due to the way crash rate is calculated (crashes per session) it is possible to have greater than 100% rate, due to fact that a session may contain multiple crashes.

## Most used [mobile-service-most-used]

Optimize your end-user experience and your application QA strategy based on your most used device models and operating system versions.

## Throughput and transactions [mobile-throughput-transactions]

The **Throughput** chart visualizes the average number of transactions per minute for the selected service.

The **Transactions** table displays a list of *transaction groups* for the selected service and includes the latency, traffic, error rate, and the impact for each transaction. Transactions that share the same name are grouped, and only one entry is displayed for each group.

By default, transaction groups are sorted by *Impact* to show the most used and slowest endpoints in your service. If there is a particular endpoint you are interested in, click **View transactions** to view a list of similar transactions on the [transactions overview](transactions-2.md) page.

## Failed transaction rate and dependencies [mobile-error-and-dependencies]

The failed transaction rate represents the percentage of failed transactions from the perspective of the selected service. It’s useful for visualizing unexpected increases, decreases, or irregular patterns in a service’s transactions.

::::{tip}
HTTP **transactions** from the HTTP server perspective do not consider a `4xx` status code (client error) as a failure because the failure was caused by the caller, not the HTTP server. Thus, `event.outcome=success` and there will be no increase in failed transaction rate.

HTTP **spans** from the client perspective however, are considered failures if the HTTP status code is ≥ 400. These spans will set `event.outcome=failure` and increase the failed transaction rate.

If there is no HTTP status, both transactions and spans are considered successful unless an error is reported.

::::


The **Dependencies** table displays a list of downstream services or external connections relevant to the service at the selected time range. The table displays latency, throughput, failed transaction rate, and the impact of each dependency. By default, dependencies are sorted by *Impact* to show the most used and the slowest dependency. If there is a particular dependency you are interested in, click **[View dependencies](dependencies.md)** to learn more about it.

::::{note}
Displaying dependencies for services instrumented with the Real User Monitoring (RUM) agent requires an agent version ≥ v5.6.3.
