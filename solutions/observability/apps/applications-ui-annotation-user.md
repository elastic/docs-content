# Applications UI annotation user [apm-app-annotation-user-create]


::::{note} 
By default, the `viewer` and `editor` built-in roles provide read access to Observability annotations. You only need to create an annotation user to write to the annotations index ([`xpack.observability.annotations.index`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/apm-settings-kb.html)).
::::



## Annotation user [apm-app-annotation-user] 

View deployment annotations in the Applications UI.

1. Create a new role, named something like `annotation_user`, and assign the following privileges:

    | Type | Privilege | Purpose |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Index | `read` on `{{ANNOTATION_INDEX}}`1 | Read-only access to the observability annotation index |
    | Index | `view_index_metadata` on `{{ANNOTATION_INDEX}}`1 | Read-only access to observability annotation index metadata |

    1 `{{ANNOTATION_INDEX}}` should be the index name youâ€™ve defined in [`xpack.observability.annotations.index`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/apm-settings-kb.html).

2. Assign the `annotation_user` created previously, and the roles and privileges necessary to create a [full](apm-reader-user.md#apm-app-reader-full) or [partial](apm-reader-user.md#apm-app-reader-partial) APM reader to any users that need to view annotations in the Applications UI
