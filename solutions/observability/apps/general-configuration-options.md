General APM Server configuration options.

:::::::{tab-set}

::::::{tab-item} APM Server binary
**Example config file:**

```yaml
apm-server:
  host: "localhost:8200"
  rum:
    enabled: true

max_procs: 4
```
::::::

::::::{tab-item} Fleet-managed
Configure and customize Fleet-managed APM settings directly in {{kib}}:

1. In {{kib}}, find **Fleet** in the main menu or use the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).
2. Under the **Agent policies** tab, select the policy you would like to configure.
3. Find the Elastic APM integration and select **Actions** > **Edit integration**.
4. Look for these settings under **General**.
