# Collect application data [apm-collect-application-data]

% is required role serverless only?

::::{admonition} Required role
:class: note

The **Admin** role or higher is required to send APM data to Elastic. To learn more, refer to [Assign user roles and privileges](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cloud-organization/user-roles.md#general-assign-user-roles).

## Language-specific options [_language_specific_options]

Use Elastic APM agents or an OpenTelemetry language SDK to instrument a service in the language its written in:

* [**Elastic APM agents**](../../../solutions/observability/apps/elastic-apm-agents.md): Elastic APM agents are instrumentation libraries written in the same language as your service.
* [**OpenTelemetry**](../../../solutions/observability/apps/use-opentelemetry-with-apm.md): OpenTelemetry is an open source set of APIs, SDKs, tooling, and integrations that enable the capture and management of telemetry data from your services and applications.

    * This option includes Elastic Distributions of OpenTelemetry, which are customized versions of [OpenTelemetry language SDKs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/) that are optimized to work with an Elastic backend.

## Service-specific options [_service_specific_options]

Elastic also offers several tools to help you collect data from specific services:

* **Kubernetes**: The Elastic APM attacher for Kubernetes simplifies the instrumentation and configuration of your application pods. Read more in the [APM attacher for Kubernetes docs](asciidocalypse://docs/apm-k8s-attacher/docs/reference/index.md).
* **AWS Lambda Functions**: Helps you monitor your AWS Lambda functions. Read more in the [APM Architecture for AWS Lambda docs](asciidocalypse://docs/apm-aws-lambda/docs/reference/index.md).
* [8.15.0] **Jaeger**: Helps you to switch an existing Jaeger setup from the default Jaeger backend to the {{stack}}. Read more in [Integrate with Jaeger](../../../solutions/observability/apps/integrate-with-jaeger-deprecated.md).
