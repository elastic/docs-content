An LLM is preconfigured as a connector, enabled by default and ready to use out of the box.
Using the preconfigured LLM enables you to use features such as Playground and AI Assistant without having an account with an LLM provider or setting up an LLM connector.
The LLM is hosted as a service and will incur additional costs.
