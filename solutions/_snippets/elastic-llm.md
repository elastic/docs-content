{{ech}} deployments and {{serverless-full}} projects include a preconfigured LLM connector that's enabled by default and ready to use.

Using the preconfigured LLM enables you to use features such as Playground and AI Assistant without having an account with an LLM provider or setting up an LLM connector.

The LLM is hosted as a service and will incur additional costs.
