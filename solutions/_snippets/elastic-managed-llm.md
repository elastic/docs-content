[Elastic Managed LLM](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/kibana/connectors-kibana/elastic-managed-llm) is the default large language model (LLM) connector available in {{kib}} for eligible users. It provides immediate access to generative AI features without requiring any setup or external model integration.

Elastic Managed LLM is available out-of-the box; it does not require manual configuration or API key management. Alternatively, you can configure and use a third-party LLM connector, such as OpenAI, Azure, or Amazon Bedrock.
