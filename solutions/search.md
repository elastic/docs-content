# Elasticsearch

{{es}} as a toolbox for your search use case enables you to build powerful search experiences for websites, applications, and enterprise data using Elastic's unified platform.

## {{es}} powers search

All of the search capabilities you find on this page are possible because {{es}} is not just a search engine, but itâ€™s also a scalable, cost-efficient [data store](/manage-data/data-store.md).
You can bring in many types of data, index them in near real time, and keep them stored in a way that makes them both searchable and analyzable. Common examples include, but are not limited to:

* **Textual data**: documents, logs, articles, or transcripts.
* **Numerical data**: metrics, performance data, sensor readings.
* **Geospatial data**: coordinates, maps, and location-based signals.
* **Vector data**: embeddings from {{ml}} models for semantic or hybrid search.

By bringing all these capabilities together, Elasticsearch serves as a powerful data store, a geospatial search engine, a vector database, and more, all within a single technology. It forms the foundation of Elastic's unified data and search platform, enabling you to work with different data types seamlessly. To learn more, refer to the [{{es}} data store overview](/manage-data/data-store.md).

## Search use cases

Think of {{es}} as a set of powerful building blocks. You bring in your own data, text, logs, metrics, events, vectors, or geospatial information, and {{es}} gives you the tools to store, search, and analyze it. By combining these capabilities, you can design and build the search and discovery experiences that fit your needs, from product catalogs to knowledge bases, chatbots, or geospatial applications.

| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vector search/hybrid search**      | Run nearest neighbour search, combine with text for hybrid results | Dense embeddings, sparse embeddings, combined with text/BM25  |
| **Ecommerce/product catalog search** | Provide fast, relevant, and up-to-date results, faceted navigation | Inventory sync, user behavior tracking, results caching       |
| **Workplace/knowledge base search**  | Search across range of data sources, enforcing permissions         | Third-party connectors, document-level security, role mapping |
| **Website search**                   | Deliver relevant, up-to-date results                               | Web crawling, incremental indexing, query caching             |
| **Customer support search**          | Surface relevant solutions, manage access controls, track metrics  | Knowledge graph, role-based access, analytics                 |
| **Chatbots/RAG**                     | Enable natural conversations, provide context, maintain knowledge  | Vector search, ML models, knowledge base integration          |
| **Geospatial search**                | Process location queries, sort by proximity, filter by area        | Geo-mapping, spatial indexing, distance calculations          |
