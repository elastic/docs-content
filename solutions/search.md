# Search

% What needs to be done: Refine

% Scope notes: surface key features buried in the search APIs, turn some of the API doc content into feature-specific tutorials  needs some polish to separate use cases from technologies

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/search-with-elasticsearch.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/what-is-elasticsearch-serverless.md
