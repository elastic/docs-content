% - [Getting started with ES|QL](esql-getting-started.md): Learn how to query and aggregate your data using ES|QL.
- [Semantic search](semantic-search/semantic-search-semantic-text.md): Learn how to create embeddings for your data with `semantic_text` and query using the `semantic` query.
 - [Hybrid search](hybrid-semantic-text.md): Learn how to combine semantic search using`semantic_text` with full-text search.
- [Bring your own dense vector embeddings](vector/bring-own-vectors.md): Learn how to ingest dense vector embeddings into Elasticsearch.

:::{tip}
To run the quickstarts, you need a running Elasticsearch cluster. Use [`start-local`](https://github.com/elastic/start-local) to set up a fast local dev environment in Docker, together with Kibana. Run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://elastic.co/start-local | sh
```
