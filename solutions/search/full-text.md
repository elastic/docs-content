# Full-text search [full-text-search]

::::{tip}
Would you prefer to start with a hands-on example? Refer to our [full-text search tutorial](querydsl-full-text-filter-tutorial.md).
::::

Full-text search, also known as lexical search, is a technique for fast, efficient searching through text fields in documents. Documents and search queries are transformed to enable returning [relevant](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/search-relevance) results instead of simply exact term matches. Fields of type [`text`](asciidocalypse://docs/elasticsearch/docs/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/text.md#text-field-type) are analyzed and indexed for full-text search.

Built on decades of information retrieval research, full-text search delivers reliable results that scale predictably as your data grows. Because it runs efficiently on CPUs, {{es}}'s full-text search requires minimal computational resources compared to GPU-intensive vector operations.

You can combine full-text search with [semantic search using vectors](semantic-search.md) to build modern hybrid search applications. While vector search may require additional GPU resources, the full-text component remains cost-effective by leveraging existing CPU infrastructure.

## Getting started [full-text-search-getting-started]


For a high-level overview of how full-text search works, refer to [How full-text search works](full-text/how-full-text-works.md).

For a hands-on introduction to full-text search, refer to the [full-text search tutorial](querydsl-full-text-filter-tutorial.md).
