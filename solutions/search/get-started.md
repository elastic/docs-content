## Core implementation decisions

% TODO add diagram

Building a search experience with {{es}} requires a number of fundamental implementation decisions:

1. [**Deployment**](/deploy-manage/index.md): Where will you run Elastic?
1. [**Ingestion**](ingest-for-search.md): What tools will you use to get your content into {{es}}? 
1. [**Search approaches**](search-approaches.md): What search techniques and algorithms will you use to find relevant results? 
1. **Implementation tools**: How will you write queries and interact with {{es}}?
   - Which [programming language client]() matches your application?
   - Which API endpoints and [query language(s)](querying-for-search.md) will you use to express your search logic?

Each decision builds on the previous ones, offering flexibility to mix and match approaches based on your needs.

Already have an {{es}} deployment? You can get started with our hands-on [quick start tutorials](api-quickstarts.md), or check out our [Python notebooks](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-labs/tree/main/notebooks#readme).
