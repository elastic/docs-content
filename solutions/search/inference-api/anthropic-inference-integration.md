# Anthropic inference integration [infer-service-anthropic]

::::{admonition} New API reference
For the most up-to-date API details, refer to [{{infer-cap}} APIs](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/group/endpoint-inference).

::::


Creates an {{infer}} endpoint to perform an {{infer}} task with the `anthropic` service.


## {{api-request-title}} [infer-service-anthropic-api-request] 

`PUT /_inference/<task_type>/<inference_id>`


## {{api-path-parms-title}} [infer-service-anthropic-api-path-params] 

`<inference_id>`
:   (Required, string) The unique identifier of the {{infer}} endpoint.

`<task_type>`
:   (Required, string) The type of the {{infer}} task that the model will perform.

    Available task types:

    * `completion`



## {{api-request-body-title}} [infer-service-anthropic-api-request-body] 

`chunking_settings`
:   (Optional, object) Chunking configuration object. Refer to [Configuring chunking](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/group/endpoint-inference) to learn more about chunking.

    `max_chunk_size`
    :   (Optional, integer) Specifies the maximum size of a chunk in words. Defaults to `250`. This value cannot be higher than `300` or lower than `20` (for `sentence` strategy) or `10` (for `word` strategy).

    `overlap`
    :   (Optional, integer) Only for `word` chunking strategy. Specifies the number of overlapping words for chunks. Defaults to `100`. This value cannot be higher than the half of `max_chunk_size`.

    `sentence_overlap`
    :   (Optional, integer) Only for `sentence` chunking strategy. Specifies the numnber of overlapping sentences for chunks. It can be either `1` or `0`. Defaults to `1`.

    `strategy`
    :   (Optional, string) Specifies the chunking strategy. It could be either `sentence` or `word`.


`service`
:   (Required, string) The type of service supported for the specified task type. In this case, `anthropic`.

`service_settings`
:   (Required, object) Settings used to install the {{infer}} model.

    These settings are specific to the `anthropic` service.

    `api_key`
    :   (Required, string) A valid API key for the Anthropic API.

    `model_id`
    :   (Required, string) The name of the model to use for the {{infer}} task. You can find the supported models at [Anthropic models](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models#model-names).

    `rate_limit`
    :   (Optional, object) By default, the `anthropic` service sets the number of requests allowed per minute to `50`. This helps to minimize the number of rate limit errors returned from Anthropic. To modify this, set the `requests_per_minute` setting of this object in your service settings:

        ```text
        "rate_limit": {
            "requests_per_minute": <<number_of_requests>>
        }
        ```


`task_settings`
:   (Required, object) Settings to configure the {{infer}} task. These settings are specific to the `<task_type>` you specified.

    ::::{dropdown} `task_settings` for the `completion` task type
    `max_tokens`
    :   (Required, integer) The maximum number of tokens to generate before stopping.

    `temperature`
    :   (Optional, float) The amount of randomness injected into the response.

        For more details about the supported range, see the [Anthropic messages API](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages).


    `top_k`
    :   (Optional, integer) Specifies to only sample from the top K options for each subsequent token.

        Recommended for advanced use cases only. You usually only need to use `temperature`.

        For more details, see the [Anthropic messages API](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages).


    `top_p`
    :   (Optional, float) Specifies to use Anthropicâ€™s nucleus sampling.

        In nucleus sampling, Anthropic computes the cumulative distribution over all the options for each subsequent token in decreasing probability order and cut it off once it reaches a particular probability specified by `top_p`. You should either alter `temperature` or `top_p`, but not both.

        Recommended for advanced use cases only. You usually only need to use `temperature`.

        For more details, see the [Anthropic messages API](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages).

## Anthropic service example [inference-example-anthropic] 

The following example shows how to create an {{infer}} endpoint called `anthropic_completion` to perform a `completion` task type.

```console
PUT _inference/completion/anthropic_completion
{
    "service": "anthropic",
    "service_settings": {
        "api_key": "<api_key>",
        "model_id": "<model_id>"
    },
    "task_settings": {
        "max_tokens": 1024
    }
}
```
