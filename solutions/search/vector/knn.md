# KNN

% What needs to be done: Refine

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/knn-search.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/elasticsearch-knn-search.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$approximate-knn$$$

$$$knn-semantic-search$$$

$$$exact-knn$$$
