# {{agent-builder}}: Agents

Agents are AI models (LLMs) defined with custom instructions and a set of assigned [tools](tools.md). Users [chat](chat.md) with agents using natural language, in the Agent Builder UI or programmatically.

An agent parses user requests to define a goal and then runs tools in a loop to achieve that goal. The agent provides responses based on its configured tools, instructions, and behavior settings.

## How agents work

When you ask a question to an agent, it analyzes your request to define a specific goal. It selects the most appropriate tool(s), and determines the right arguments to use. The agent evaluates the information returned after each action and decides whether to use additional tools or formulate a response. This iterative process of tool selection, execution, and analysis continues until the agent can provide a complete answer.

{{agent-builder}} includes a default agent (named `Elastic AI Agent`) with access to all built-in tools. You can create specialized agents with custom instructions and selected tools to address specific use cases or workflows.

:::{note}
The default `Elastic AI Agent` is immutable and cannot be edited. To customize agent behavior, you need to create a custom agent by cloning the default agent or creating a new one from scratch.

## Manage your agents

The **Agents** page provides a centralized view of all your agents. From this page you can:

- View all your agents with their names and labels
- Search for specific agents using the search bar
- Filter agents by labels using the **Labels** dropdown
- Create new agents using the **+ New agent** button
- Start chatting with an agent or perform other actions
    - **Elastic AI Agent**: you can **chat** or **clone** the default agent using the chat or clone buttons. The default agent cannot be edited directly.
