# Get started with {{agent-builder}}

Learn how get started by enabling the {{agent-builder}} features and begin chatting with your data.

:::::{stepper}
::::{step} Set up an Elastic deployment

If you don't already have an Elastic deployment, refer to [Choose your deployment type](/solutions/search/get-started.md#choose-your-deployment-type).

:::{note}
For {{ech}} deployments, make sure you are using the solution navigation instead of classic navigation.
You can set up a new [space](/deploy-manage/manage-spaces.md) to use the solution nav.

::::{step} Enable {{agent-builder}}

{{agent-builder}} is disabled by default in the initial release, so you'll need to enable the feature to get started.

You can enable the features using the UI:

1. Navigate to **Stack Management > Settings**
2. Find **AI > Agent Builder** in the left-hand navigation
3. Toggle **{{agent-builder}}** to on
4. Click **Save changes**

Refresh the browser page and find **Agents** in the navigation menu to start using the feature.
You can also search for **Agent Builder** in the [global search bar](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).

::::{step} Ingest some data

Before you get started with agents, you need some data in your {{es}} cluster. Otherwise, you'll just be chatting to the underlying LLM without any retrieval-augmented context.

To learn about adding data for search use cases, go to [](/solutions/search/ingest-for-search.md).
For a broader overview of ingestion options, go to [](/manage-data/ingest.md).

:::{tip}
If you're not ready to add your own data, you can use the Elastic [sample data](/manage-data/ingest/sample-data.md) or create small data sets when you follow the instructions in the [quickstarts](/solutions/search/get-started/quickstarts.md).

::::{step} Start chatting

The **Agent Chat** UI provides a conversational interface where you can interact with agents and explore your data using natural language. {{agent-builder}} includes a default agent named `Elastic AI Agent` with access to all built-in tools, so you can start chatting immediately.

Learn more in [Agent Chat](chat.md).


::::

::::{step} Start building agents and tools

Once you've tested the built-in **Elastic AI Agent** with the [default Elastic tools](tools.md, you'll want to start [building your own agents](agent-builder-agents.md#create-a-new-agent) with custom instructions and creating your own [tools](tools.md#create-custom-tools) to assign them.
