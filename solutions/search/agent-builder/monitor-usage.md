# Token usage in Elastic Agent Builder

When using {{agent-builder}}, total token usage typically exceeds the visible conversation text. Because {{agent-builder}} utilizes an agentic framework, a single user request often triggers multiple model calls (rounds) to process reasoning steps, run tools, and interpret results.

Token counts include:

* **Input Tokens:** These accumulate throughout the session. They include the user's current query, the conversation history from previous rounds, system prompts, and the results returned from any tools used during execution.
* **Output Tokens:** These include the final response visible to the user, as well as all internal reasoning steps, tool calls, and intermediate results generated by the model.

:::{note}
As the conversation history grows and the agent performs more complex reasoning loops, the input and output token count increases multiplicatively for each round of execution.
