# Query rules UI
Query rules help customize search results, giving you more control over how results are returned based on the contextual information in the query.
Query rules UI is a user interface that helps you create, edit, and delete query rules. The interface is implemented on top of the existing Query Rules API.

The UI enables you to:

- Set keyword triggers and conditions for when rules apply
- Pin, boost, or exclude specific documents in results
- Organize rules into rulesets and set execution priority
- Test rules against sample queries before publishing

## UI vs. API: What's the difference?

All the functionality in the UI works the same as in API calls. The only difference is that the Query Rules UI will create pinning by `docs` over `ids`. It'll still allow edits in a simple form for `id` pinning. For more information on Rule actions, refer [Rule actions](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/rest-apis/searching-with-query-rules#query-rule-actions).

To see examples of how to search using query rules, refer [Search using Query Rules API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/rest-apis/searching-with-query-rules).

If you prefer to use the Query Rules API, refer to [Query Rules API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/group/endpoint-query_rules).

## Requirements

If you want to get full access to the Query Rules UI, you must have the following privileges:

* Appropriate roles to access Kibana. For more information, refer to [Built-in roles](https://www.elastic.co/docs/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/built-in-roles) or  [Kibana privileges](https://www.elastic.co/docs/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/kibana-privileges)
* A custom role with `manage_search_query_rules` cluster privilege
* `ALL` option for `Query Rules` role privilege in the respective Kibana space

## Using the UI

Go to your deployment and select **Query Rules** from the left navigation menu under **Relevance**. If you're not able to see the option, contact the administrator to review the role assigned to you.

   For more information on rule types, refer [Rule types](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/rest-apis/searching-with-query-rules#query-rule-type).
4. Select one or more documents for the rule to apply to.
5. Select one of the following rule criteria:
    - **Always**: Apply the rule to all queries
    - **Custom**: Define conditions when the rule is applied.

   For a full list of options, refer [Rule criteria](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/rest-apis/searching-with-query-rules.md#query-rule-criteria).
6. Select **Create rule**.
7. Select **Save** in the top right corner of the ruleset section.

### Test and validate a ruleset
To test a query ruleset, do the following:
1. Select **Query Rules** in the navigation menu under **Relevance**.
2. Select a ruleset.
3. Select **Test in Console**.

	A console window opens containing a sample query using the [rule retriever](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/rest-apis/retrievers/rule-retriever.md).

	```console
	GET books/_search
	{
	  "retriever": {
	    "rule": {
	      // Update your criteria to test different results
	      "match_criteria": {
	       "query_string": "Stephenson"
	     },
	      "ruleset_ids": [
	        "first-ruleset"
	      ],
	      "retriever": {
	        "standard": {
	          "query": {
	            "match_all": {} <1>
	          }
	        }
	      }
	    }
	  }
	}
	```
	1. Modify the search query if needed.

4. Run the query.
5. Review results to confirm if the rule actions were applied as expected.
