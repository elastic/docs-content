# {{es}} Model Context Protocol (MCP) server

Connect to your Elasticsearch data directly from any MCP Client (like Claude Desktop) using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

This server enables connecting agents to your Elasticsearch data and allows you to interact with your Elasticsearch indices through natural language conversations.

Learn more in the [elastic/mcp-server-elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/mcp-server-elasticsearch?tab=readme-ov-file#elasticsearch-mcp-server) GitHub repository.
