# Search approaches

To deliver relevant search results, you need to choose the right search approach for your data and use case.

The following table provides an overview of the fundamental search techniques available in {{es}}:

| Name | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|--------|
| [**Full-text search**](full-text.md) | Traditional lexical search with analyzers and relevance tuning | Essential foundation for keyword matching, works out of the box |
| [**Vector search**](vector.md) | Similarity search using numerical vectors | Requires extra setup/resources, ideal for finding similar documents |
| [**Semantic search**](semantic-search.md) | Meaning-based search using natural language understanding | Requires ML models and vector infrastructure |
| [**Hybrid search**](hybrid-semantic-text.md) | Combines lexical and vector/semantic approaches | Best balance for both keyword precision and semantic relevance |
| [**Re-ranking**](ranking/semantic-reranking.md) | Post-processing results to improve relevance | Optional ML-based enhancement for fine-tuned relevance |
| [**Geospatial search**](/explore-analyze/geospatial-analysis.md) | Location-based search and spatial relationships | For maps, distance calculations, and shape queries |

:::::{tip}
 Full-text search is a very powerful tool in itself. One of the key strengths of {{es}} is its flexibility, allowing you to start with full-text search and gradually incorporate more complex or resource-intensive approaches over time.

Once you've chosen your search approach(es), you'll need to select a query language to implement them. Refer to [query languages for search use cases](querying-for-search.md) to learn about the available options.
