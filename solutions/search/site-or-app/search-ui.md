### Is Search UI only for React? [overview-is-search-ui-only-for-react]

Search UI is "headless". You can use vanilla JavaScript or write support for it into any JavaScript framework.

[Read about the search-ui package](https://github.com/elastic/search-ui/tree/main/packages/search-ui) for more information, or check out the [Vue.js Example](https://github.com/elastic/vue-search-ui-demo).

You can!

Yes! Absolutely.

Check out the [Build Your Own Component Guide](search-ui://reference/guides-creating-own-components.md).

Nope! We do have two first party connectors: Site Search and App Search.

But Search UI is headless. You can use *any* Search API.

Read the [Building a custom connector](search-ui://reference/guides-building-custom-connector.md) to learn more about building your own connector for your API.
