# Configure network map data

% What needs to be done: Align serverless/stateful

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/security-docs/security/conf-map-ui.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/security-conf-map-ui.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$geo-pipeleine$$$

$$$geoip-data$$$

$$$kibana-index-pattern$$$

$$$private-network$$$
