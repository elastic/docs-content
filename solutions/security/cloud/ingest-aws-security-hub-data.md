# AWS Security Hub
This page explains how to make data from the AWS Security Hub integration appear in the following places within {{elastic-sec}}:

- **Findings page**: Data appears on the [Misconfigurations](/solutions/security/cloud/findings-page.md) tab.
- **Alert and Entity details flyouts**: Applicable data appears in the [Insights section](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/view-detection-alert-details.md#insights-section).

In order for AWS Security Hub data to appear in these workflows:

* Follow the steps to [set up the AWS Security Hub integration](https://docs.elastic.co/en/integrations/aws/securityhub).
* Make sure the integration version is at least 2.31.1.
* Ensure you have `read` privileges for the `security_solution-*.misconfiguration_latest` index.
* While configuring the AWS Security Hub integration, turn on **Collect AWS Security Hub Findings from AWS**. We recommend you also set the **Initial Interval** value to `2160h` (equivalent to 90 days) to ingest existing logs.
