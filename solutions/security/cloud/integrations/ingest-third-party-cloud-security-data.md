# Ingest third-party cloud security data

This section describes how to ingest cloud security data from third-party tools into {{es}}. Once ingested, this data can provide additional context and enrich your {{elastic-sec}} workflows.

You can ingest both third-party cloud workload protection data and third-party security posture and vulnerability data.


## Ingest third-party workload protection data [_ingest_third_party_workload_protection_data]

You can ingest third-party cloud security alerts into {{elastic-sec}} to view them on the [Alerts page](/solutions/security/advanced-entity-analytics/view-analyze-risk-score-data.md#alerts-page) and incorporate them into your triage and threat hunting workflows.

* Learn to [ingest alerts from Sysdig Falco](/solutions/security/cloud/ingest-cncf-falco-data.md).


## Ingest third-party security posture and vulnerability data [_ingest_third_party_security_posture_and_vulnerability_data]

You can ingest third-party data into {{elastic-sec}} to review and investigate it alongside data collected by {{elastic-sec}}'s native cloud security integrations. Once ingested, cloud security posture and vulnerability data appears on the [Findings](/solutions/security/cloud/findings-page.md) page, on the [Cloud Posture dashboard](/solutions/security/dashboards/cloud-security-posture-dashboard.md), and in the [entity details](/solutions/security/advanced-entity-analytics/view-entity-details.md#entity-details-flyout) and [alert details](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/view-detection-alert-details.md#insights-section) flyouts.

::::{note}
Data from third-party integrations does not appear on the [CNVM dashboard](/solutions/security/cloud/cnvm-dashboard.md).
::::

Data from each of the following integrations can feed into at least some of these workflows:

* [AWS Config](/solutions/security/cloud/integrations/aws-config.md)
* [AWS Inspector](/solutions/security/cloud/integrations/aws-inspector.md)
* [AWS Security Hub](/solutions/security/cloud/integrations/aws-security-hub.md).
* [CNCF Falco](/solutions/security/cloud/integrations/cncf-falco.md)
* [Google Security Command Center](/solutions/security/cloud/integrations/google-security-command-center.md)
* [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/solutions/security/cloud/integrations/microsoft-defender-for-cloud.md).
* [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/solutions/security/cloud/integrations/microsoft-defender-for-endpoint.md).
* [Microsoft Defender XDR](/solutions/security/cloud/integrations/microsoft-defender-xdr.md).
* [Qualys VMDR](/solutions/security/cloud/integrations/qualys.md).
