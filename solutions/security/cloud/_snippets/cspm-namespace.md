   ```{note}
   Using a namespace can help you organize your data, for example you query data from a particular namespace, or filter the Cloud Security dashboard based on namespace. Do not try to use data stream namespaces to manage data access within your organization â€” this is ineffective because the default findings index includes data from all namespaces (`logs-findings*`). Use [document-level security](elasticsearch://reference/search-connectors/document-level-security.md) instead.
