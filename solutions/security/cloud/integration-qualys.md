# Qualys VMDR

This page explains how to make data from the Qualys Vulnerability Management, Detection and Response integration (Qualys VMDR) appear in the following places within {{elastic-sec}}:

- **Findings page**: Data appears on the [Vulnerabilities](/solutions/security/cloud/findings-page-3.md) tab.
- **Alert and Entity details flyouts** Applicable data appears in the [Insights section](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/view-detection-alert-details.md#insights-section).

:::{note}
Data from this integration does not appear on the [CNVM dashboard](/solutions/security/cloud/cnvm-dashboard.md).
:::

In order for Qualys VMDR data to appear in these workflows:

- Ensure you have read privileges for the following index: `security_solution-*.vulnerability_latest`.
- Follow the steps to [set up the Qualys VMDR integration](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/integrations/qualys_vmdr).
  - While configuring the integration, in the **Host detection data** section, under **Input parameters**, enter `host_metadata=all`. This enables the ingest of `cloud.*` fields.
- ({{stack}} users) Ensure you're on at least v8.16.
- Make sure the integration version is at least 6.0.0

:::{note}
You can ingest data from the Qualys VMDR integration for other purposes without following these steps.
