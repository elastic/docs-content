# Third-party response actions

% What needs to be done: Align serverless/stateful

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/security-docs/security/third-party-actions.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/security-third-party-actions.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$crowdstrike-response-actions$$$

$$$security-third-party-actions-supported-systems-and-response-actions$$$
