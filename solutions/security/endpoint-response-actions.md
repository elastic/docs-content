% What needs to be done: Align serverless/stateful

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/security-docs/security/response-actions.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/security-response-actions.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$actions-log$$$

$$$get-file$$$

$$$help-panel$$$

$$$kill-process$$$

$$$processes$$$

$$$response-action-commands$$$
