# Rule exceptions

% What needs to be done: Lift-and-shift

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/security-docs/security/detections-ui-exceptions.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/security-rule-exceptions.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$rule-exceptions-intro$$$

$$$shared-exception-list-intro$$$
