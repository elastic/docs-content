# Manage detection rules

% What needs to be done: Align serverless/stateful

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/security-docs/security/rules-ui-management.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/security-rules-ui-management.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$sort-filter-rules$$$

$$$manually-run-rules$$$

$$$import-export-rules-ui$$$

$$$edit-rules-settings$$$

$$$manage-rules-ui$$$

$$$rule-prerequisites$$$

$$$rule-status$$$

$$$snooze-rule-actions$$$
