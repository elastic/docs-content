% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/security-docs/security/detections-permissions-section.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/security-detections-requirements.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$enable-detections-ui$$$

$$$adv-list-settings$$$

$$$detections-on-prem-requirements$$$
