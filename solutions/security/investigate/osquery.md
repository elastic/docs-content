# Osquery

% What needs to be done: Refine

% Scope notes: Align serverless/stateful + combine with Kibana Osquery intro page

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/security-docs/security/use-osquery.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/security-query-operating-systems.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/kibana/kibana/osquery.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$osquery-map-fields$$$

$$$osquery-prebuilt-packs$$$

$$$osquery-manage-query$$$

$$$osquery-results$$$

$$$osquery-status$$$
