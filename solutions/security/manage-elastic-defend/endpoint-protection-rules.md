# Endpoint protection rules [endpoint-protection-rules]

Endpoint protection rules are [prebuilt rules](../detect-and-alert/install-manage-elastic-prebuilt-rules.md) designed to help you manage and respond to alerts generated by {{elastic-endpoint}}, the installed component that performs {{elastic-defend}}'s threat monitoring and prevention. These rules include the Endpoint Security rule as well as additional detection and prevention rules for different {{elastic-defend}} protection features.

::::{important}
To receive {{elastic-endpoint}} alerts, you must install {{agent}} and the {{elastic-defend}} integration  on your hosts (refer to [Install {{elastic-defend}}](../configure-elastic-defend/install-elastic-defend.md)).
::::


When endpoint protection rules are triggered, {{elastic-endpoint}} alerts are displayed as detection alerts in the {{security-app}}. The detection alert name is taken from the {{elastic-endpoint}} alert message and overwrites the prebuilt rule name in the Alerts table. For example, for malware protection, the following {{elastic-endpoint}} alerts are displayed as detection alerts:

* Malware Prevention Alert
* Malware Detection Alert


## Endpoint Security rule [endpoint-sec-rule]

The Endpoint Security rule automatically creates an alert from all incoming {{elastic-endpoint}} alerts.

::::{note}
When you install Elastic prebuilt rules, the {{elastic-defend}} is enabled by default.
::::



## Feature-specific protection rules [feature-protection-rules]

The following endpoint protection rules give you more granular control over how you handle the generated alerts. These rules are tailored for each of {{elastic-defend}}'s endpoint protection featuresâ€”malware, ransomware, memory threats, and malicious behavior. Enabling these rules allows you to configure more specific actions based on the protection feature and whether the malicious activity was prevented or detected.

* Behavior - Detected - Elastic Defend
* Behavior - Prevented - Endpoint Defend
* Malicious File - Detected - Elastic Defend
* Malicious File - Prevented - Elastic Defend
* Memory Signature - Detected - Elastic Defend
* Memory Signature - Prevented - Elastic Defend
* Ransomware - Detected - Elastic Defend
* Ransomware - Prevented - Elastic Defend

::::{note}
If you choose to use the feature-specific protection rules, we recommend that you disable the Endpoint Security rule, as using both will result in duplicate alerts.
::::


To use these rules, you need to manually enable them from the **Rules** page in the {{security-app}}. Follow the instructions for [installing and enabling Elastic prebuilt rules](../detect-and-alert/install-manage-elastic-prebuilt-rules.md#load-prebuilt-rules).


## Endpoint security exception handling [_endpoint_security_exception_handling]

All endpoint protection rules share a common exception list called the Endpoint Security Exception List. This ensures that if you switch between using the Endpoint Security rule and the feature-specific protection rules, your existing [{{elastic-endpoint}} exceptions](../detect-and-alert/add-manage-exceptions.md#endpoint-rule-exceptions) continue to apply.
