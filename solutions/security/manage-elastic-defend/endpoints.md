% What needs to be done: Align serverless/stateful

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/security-docs/security/admin-page-ov.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/security-endpoints-page.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$endpoint-details$$$

$$$integration-policy-details$$$

$$$policy-status$$$

$$$response-action-history-tab$$$
