# Privileged user monitoring

Privileged user monitoring allows you to track the activity of users with elevated permissions, such as system administrators or users with access to sensitive data. These accounts are often targets for attackers who try to gain elevated privileges and access critical systems. To reduce this risk, it’s important to monitor and audit privileged users’ behavior regularly. 

Use privileged user monitoring to proactively identify suspicious activities, such as over-provisioning of rights or malicious insider threats, before they cause damage.

The [Privileged user monitoring dashboard](/solutions/security/advanced-entity-analytics/monitor-privileged-user-activitites.md) gives you a centralized, high-level view of privileged users’ activity. It helps you identify suspicious behavior, prioritize investigations, and quickly access the data you need to respond.
