# Optimizing anomaly results

% What needs to be done: Lift-and-shift

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/security-docs/security/tuning-anomaly-results.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/security-tuning-anomaly-results.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$add-job-filter$$$

$$$clone-job$$$

$$$create-fiter-list$$$

$$$define-rule-threshold$$$

$$$rarely-used-processes$$$
