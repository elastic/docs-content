# Get started [getting-started]

New to {{elastic-sec}}? Follow the instructions in this topic to get started. Then, review the rest of the Get Started section to learn how to use the UI, review requirements, and discover more about our security features.

::::::{{stepper}}
:::::{{step}} Choose your deployment type   

Elastic provides several self-managed and Elastic-managed options. For simplicity and speed, we recommend [](./elastic-security-serverless.md), which enables you to run {{elastic-sec}} in fully managed environment so you don’t have to manage the underlying {{es}} cluster and {{kib}} instances.

::::{dropdown} Create an Elastic Security Serverless project

There are two options to create serverless projects:
- If you're a new user, [sign up for a free 14-day trial](https://cloud.elastic.co/serverless-registration) to create a serverless project. For more information about the {[ecloud]} trials, check out [Trial features](/docs/deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/create-an-organization#general-sign-up-trial-what-is-included-in-my-trial).
- If you're an existing customer, [log in to {{ecloud}}](https://cloud.elastic.co/login) and follow [these instructions to create a serverless project](./get-started/create-security-project.md). 

:::{note}
You need the `admin` predefined role or an equivalent custom role to create projects. For more information, refer to [User roles and privileges](https://www.elastic.co/docs/deploy-manage/users-roles/cloud-organization/user-roles).
:::

After you've created your project, you're ready to move on to the next step.
::::

Alternatively, if you prefer a self-managed deployment, you can create a [local development installation](https://www.elastic.co/docs/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/local-development-installation-quickstart) in Docker:
    
```sh
curl -fsSL https://elastic.co/start-local | sh
```

::::{{step}} Ingest your data 


After you've deployed {{elastic-sec}}, the next step is to get data into the product before you can search, analyze, or use any visualization tools. The easiest way to get data into {{elastic-sec}} is through one of our integrations—a pre-packaged collection of assets that allows you to easily collect, store, and visualize any data from any source. You can add an integration directly from the **Get Started** page within the **Ingest your data** section:
1. At the top of page, click **Set up Security**. 
2. In the Ingest your data section, click Add data with integrations. 
3. Choose from one of our recommended integrations, or select another tab to browse by category.

Elastic also provides different [ingestion methods](integration-docs://reference/index.md#ingestion-methods) to meet your infrastructure needs. 

:::{{tip}}
If you have data from a source that doesn't yet have an integration, you can use our [Automatic Import tool](/solutions/security/get-started/automatic-import.md).
