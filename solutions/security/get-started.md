# Get started [getting-started]

New to {{elastic-sec}}? Discover more about our security features and how to get started. This section describes how to set up {{elastic-sec}}, install {{agent}} and the {{elastic-defend}} integration on your hosts, and use the {{elastic-sec}} UI in {{kib}}.

:::::{{stepper}}
::::{{step}} Choose your deployment type 

Elastic provides several self-managed or Elastic-managed options for you to install {{elastic-sec}}. For simplicity and speed, we recommend one of our {{ecloud}} options. Check out our [deployment types](/deploy-manage/deploy.md#choosing-your-deployment-type) to learn more.

::::{{step}} Ingest your data 
After you've deployed {{elastic-sec}}, the next step is to get data into the product before you can search, analyze, or use any visualization tools. The easiest way to get data into Security is through one of our integrationsâ€”a pre-packaged collection of assets that allows you to easily collect, store, and visualize any data from any source. You can add an integration directly from the **Get Started** page within the **Ingest your data** section. Choose from one of our recommended integrations, or select one of the other tabs to browse by category. Elastic also provides different [ingestion methods](integration-docs://reference/index.md#ingestion-methods) to meet your infrastructure needs. 

:::{{tip}}
If you have data from a source that doesn't yet have an integration, you can use our [Automatic Import tool](/solutions/security/get-started/automatic-import.md).
