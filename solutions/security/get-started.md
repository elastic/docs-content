# Get started with {{elastic-sec}} [getting-started]

New to {{elastic-sec}}? Follow the instructions in this topic to get started. Then, review the rest of the Get Started section to learn how to use the UI, review requirements, and discover more about our security features.

:::::{{stepper}}
::::{{step}} Install the Elastic Stack  

To use {{elastic-sec}}, at minimum, you'll need to install {{es}} and {{kib}}—the core components of the {{stack}}. Elastic provides several self-managed or Elastic-managed installation options. For simplicity and speed, we recommend one of our [{{ecloud}}](/deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud.md) options—either {{ech}} or {{serverless-full}}. However, if you prefer to install Elastic on your own infrastructure, you can deploy a [self-managed cluster](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed.md). Check out our [deployment types](/deploy-manage/deploy.md#choosing-your-deployment-type) to learn more.

::::{{step}} Ingest your data 


After you've deployed {{elastic-sec}}, the next step is to get data into the product before you can search, analyze, or use any visualization tools. The easiest way to get data into {{elastic-sec}} is through one of our integrations—a pre-packaged collection of assets that allows you to easily collect, store, and visualize any data from any source. You can add an integration directly from the **Get Started** page within the **Ingest your data** section. Choose from one of our recommended integrations, or select another tab to browse by category. Elastic also provides different [ingestion methods](integration-docs://reference/index.md#ingestion-methods) to meet your infrastructure needs. 

:::{{tip}}
If you have data from a source that doesn't yet have an integration, you can use our [Automatic Import tool](/solutions/security/get-started/automatic-import.md).
