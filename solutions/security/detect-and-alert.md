% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/security-docs/security/detection-engine-overview.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/security-detection-engine-overview.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$support-indicator-rules$$$

$$$detections-permissions$$$
