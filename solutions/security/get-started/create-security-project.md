# Create an {{sec-serverless}} project [security-create-project]

An {{sec-serverless}} project enables you to run {{elastic-sec}} in an autoscaled and fully managed environment, where you donâ€™t have to manage the underlying {{es}} cluster and {{kib}} instances.

## Create project [security-create-project-create-project]

Use your {{ecloud}} account to create a fully managed {{sec-serverless}} project:

1. Navigate to [cloud.elastic.co](https://cloud.elastic.co/).
2. Log in to your {{ecloud}} account and select **Create project** from the **Serverless projects** panel.
3. Select **Next** from the **Security** panel.
4. Name your project and select your feature tier. For more information about tiers, refer to [pricing](https://www.elastic.co/pricing/serverless-security). 
5. Select a cloud provider and region.
6. Select **Create project**. It takes a few minutes to create your project.
7. Once the project is ready, select **Continue** to open the **Get started** page (you might need to log in to {{ecloud}} again).

    From here, you can learn more about {{elastic-sec}} features and start setting up your workspace.
