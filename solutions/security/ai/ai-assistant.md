::::{warning}
The Elastic AI Assistant is designed to enhance your analysis with smart dialogues. Its capabilities are still developing. Users should exercise caution as the quality of its responses might vary. Your insights and feedback will help us improve this feature. Always cross-verify AI-generated advice for accuracy.
::::

::::{admonition} Requirements
* {{stack}} users: {{stack}} version 8.8.1 or later. Also note the Generative AI connector was renamed to OpenAI connector in 8.11.0.
* {{stack}} users: an [Enterprise subscription](https://www.elastic.co/pricing).
* {{serverless-short}} users: a [Security Analytics Complete subscription](/deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/project-settings.md).
* To use AI Assistant, the **Elastic AI Assistant : All** and **Actions and Connectors : Read** [privileges](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/kibana-privileges.md).
* To set up AI Assistant, the **Actions and Connectors : All** [privilege](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/kibana-privileges.md).

::::

## Your data and AI Assistant [data-information]

Elastic does not store or examine prompts or results used by AI Assistant, or use this data for model training. This includes anything you send the model, such as alert or event data, detection rule configurations, queries, and prompts. However, any data you provide to AI Assistant will be processed by the third-party large language model (LLM) provider you connected to as part of AI Assistant setup.

Elastic does not control third-party tools, and assumes no responsibility or liability for their content, operation, or use, nor for any loss or damage that may arise from your using such tools. Exercise caution when using AI tools with personal, sensitive, or confidential information. Any data you submit may be used by the provider for AI training or other purposes. There is no guarantee that the provider will keep any information you provide secure or confidential. You should familiarize yourself with the privacy practices and terms of use of any generative AI tools prior to use.

::::{note}
Elastic can automatically anonymize event data that you provide to AI Assistant as context. To learn more, refer to [Configure AI Assistant](/solutions/security/ai/ai-assistant.md#configure-ai-assistant).
::::

## Set up AI Assistant [set-up-ai-assistant]

You must create a generative AI connector before you can use AI Assistant. AI Assistant can connect to multiple large language model (LLM) providers so you can select the best model for your needs. To set up a connector, refer to [LLM connector setup guides](/solutions/security/ai/set-up-connectors-for-large-language-models-llm.md).

::::{admonition} Recommended models
While AI Assistant is compatible with many different models, refer to the [Large language model performance matrix](/solutions/security/ai/large-language-model-performance-matrix.md) to select models that perform well with your desired use cases.

::::

### Elastic Managed LLM [elastic-managed-llm-security-ai-assistant]

:::{include} ../../_snippets/elastic-managed-llm.md
:::

## Start chatting [start-chatting]

To open AI Assistant, select the **AI Assistant** button in the top toolbar from anywhere in the {{security-app}}. You can also use the keyboard shortcut **Cmd + ;** (or **Ctrl + ;** on Windows).

:::{image} /solutions/images/security-ai-assistant-button.png
:alt: AI Assistant button
:screenshot:
:::

This opens the **Welcome** chat interface, where you can ask general questions about {{elastic-sec}}.

You can also chat with AI Assistant from several particular pages in {{elastic-sec}} where you can easily send context-specific data and prompts to AI Assistant.

* [Alert details](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/view-detection-alert-details.md) or Event details flyout: Click **Chat** while viewing the details of an alert or event.
* [Rules page](/solutions/security/detect-and-alert/manage-detection-rules.md): Use AI Assistant to help create or correct rule queries.
* [Data Quality dashboard](/solutions/security/dashboards/data-quality-dashboard.md): Select the **Incompatible fields** tab, then click **Chat**. (This is only available for fields marked red, indicating they’re incompatible).

::::{note}
Each user’s chat history (up to the 99 most recent conversations) and custom Quick Prompts are automatically saved, so you can leave {{elastic-sec}} and return to a conversation later. Chat history appears to the left of the AI Assistant chat window, and on the **Conversations** tab of the **AI Assistant settings** menu. To access the settings menu, use the global search field to search for "AI Assistant for Security" or open the menu in the upper-right of the AI Assistant chat window.
::::

## Interact with AI Assistant [interact-with-assistant]

Use these optional features to adjust and act on your conversations with AI Assistant:

* Select a *System Prompt* at the beginning of a conversation by using the **Select Prompt** menu. System Prompts provide context to the model, informing its response. To create a System Prompt, open the System Prompts dropdown menu and click **+ Add new System Prompt…**.
* {applies_to}`stack: ga 9.1` Select a *prompt tile* to start your conversation with a predefined goal or topic. Prompt tiles help you begin structured tasks or investigations into common {{elastic-sec}} workflows. The available prompt tiles include:

   * **Alerts**: Quickly identify and prioritize the most important alerts from the last 24 hours.
   * **Research**: Get a summary of the latest {{elastic-sec}} Labs research articles.
   * **Query**: Generate {{esql}} queries based on a specific goal or requirement.
   * **Suggest**: Explore the types of questions you can ask AI Assistant about {{elastic-sec}}.

* {applies_to}`stack: removed 9.1` Select a default *Quick Prompt* at the bottom of the chat window to get help writing a prompt for a specific purpose, such as summarizing an alert or converting a query from a legacy SIEM to {{elastic-sec}}. The default Quick Prompts' availability varies based on context—for example, the **Alert summarization** Quick Prompt appears when you open AI Assistant while viewing an alert.

* Create new custom Quick Prompts by clicking **Add quick prompt**.

:::{tip}
System Prompts and Quick Prompts can also be [configured](#configure-ai-assistant) from the corresponding tabs on the **Security AI settings** page. 
:::

* In an active conversation, you can use the inline actions that appear on messages to incorporate AI Assistant’s responses into your workflows:

    * **Add note to timeline** (![Add note icon](/solutions/images/security-icon-add-note.png "title =20x20")): Add the selected text to your currently active Timeline as a note.
    * **Add to existing case** (![Add to case icon](/solutions/images/security-icon-add-to-case.png "title =20x20")): Add a comment to an existing case using the selected text.
    * **Copy to clipboard** (![Copy to clipboard icon](/solutions/images/security-icon-copy.png "title =20x20")): Copy the text to clipboard to paste elsewhere. Also helpful for resubmitting a previous prompt.
    * **Add to timeline** (![Add to timeline icon](/solutions/images/security-icon-add-to-timeline.png "title =20x20")): Add a filter or query to Timeline using the text. This button appears for particular queries in AI Assistant’s responses.

Be sure to specify which language you’d like AI Assistant to use when writing a query. For example: "Can you generate an Event Query Language query to find four failed logins followed by a successful login?"

::::{tip}
AI Assistant can remember particular information you tell it to remember. For example, you could tell it: "When anwering any question about srv-win-s1-rsa or an alert that references it, mention that this host is in the New York data center". This will cause it to remember the detail you highlighted.
::::

## Share conversations

```{applies_to}
stack: ga 9.2
serverless: ga
```

Conversations that you start with AI Assistant are private by default and not visible to other members of your team. You have two ways to share conversations - either with selected members or more broadly to everyone with access to the space.

To share a conversation, do one of the following:

- Click the **Private** / **Shared** / **Restricted** badge next to the conversation's title. Use the dropdown menu to define the chat's visibility. If you select **Restricted**, a modal appears where you can select which users have access.
  ::::{image} /solutions/images/ai-assistant-shared-status-badge.png
  :alt: AI Assistant chat with the sharing status dropdown open
  :screenshot:
  ::::
- Go to **AI Assistant settings -> Conversations** to view all conversations you've started. Update their visibility as desired.


Once a conversation is shared, you can copy its URL to easily link it to your team:

- Open an AI Assistant chat, open the **Conversation settings** menu and select **Copy URL**.
- Open the **Conversations** tab of the AI Assistant settings page, then select the one you want to share and click **Copy URL**.

When someone shares a chat with you, you can review it but can't continue the conversation, since it is owned by another user. However, you can duplicate a shared conversation and continue where your colleague left off. To duplicate a shared conversation:

- Open an AI Assistant chat, open the **Conversation settings** menu and select **Duplicate**.
- Open the **Conversations** tab of the AI Assistant settings page, then select the one you want to duplicate and click **Duplicate**.

There are several [audit events](kibana://reference/kibana-audit-events.md) related to conversation sharing. Click each title to show an example:

## Configure AI Assistant [configure-ai-assistant]

To adjust general AI Assistant settings from the chat window, click the **Assistant settings menu** button in the upper-right. 

::::{image} /solutions/images/security-ai-assistant-settings-menu.png
:alt: AI Assistant's settings popover
:screenshot:
::::

The first three options (**AI Assistant settings**, **Knowledge Base**, and **Anonymization**) open the corresponding tabs of the **Security AI settings** page. The **Alerts to analyze** button allows you to adjust how many alerts to include as context for your conversation.

The **Security AI settings** page provides a range of configuration options for AI Assistant. To access it directly, use the global search field to search for "AI Assistant for Security".

It has the following tabs:

* **Conversations:** The **Streaming** setting controls whether AI Assistant’s responses appear word-by-word (streamed), or as a complete block of text. After the streaming setting is a list of all saved conversations. From here you can change their visibility, system prompt, and connector.
* **Connectors:** Manage all LLM connectors.
* **System Prompts:** Edit existing System Prompts or create new ones. To create a new System Prompt, type a unique name in the **Name** field, then press **enter**. Under **Prompt**, enter or update the System Prompt’s text. Under **Contexts**, select where the System Prompt should appear.
* **Quick Prompts:** Modify existing Quick Prompts or create new ones. To create a new Quick Prompt, type a unique name in the **Name** field, then press **enter**. Under **Prompt**, enter or update the Quick Prompt’s text.
* **Anonymization:** Select fields to include as plaintext, to obfuscate, and to not send when you provide events to AI Assistant as context. [Learn more](/solutions/security/ai/ai-assistant.md#ai-assistant-anonymization).
* **Knowledge base:** Provide additional context to AI Assistant. [Learn more](/solutions/security/ai/ai-assistant-knowledge-base.md).


To adjust the settings for a specific chat, click the **Conversation settings** button in the upper-right of its chat window. 

::::{image} /solutions/images/security-ai-assistant-chat-options-menu.png
:alt: AI Assistant's chat options menu
:screenshot:
::::

The **Copy URL** and **Duplicate** options allow you to share conversations (by sending their URL) and to continue conversations that were shared with you (by duplicating them). The **Delete** option appears for the conversation owner only and allows you to remove a saved conversation.

Settings in the **Chat options** section affect display-only user settings: whether to show or hide anonymized values, and whether to include citations. When citations are enabled, AI Assistant will refer you to information sources including data you've shared with it, information you've added to the [knowledge base](/solutions/security/ai/ai-assistant-knowledge-base.md), and content from Elastic's Security Labs and [product documentation](/solutions/security/ai/ai-assistant-knowledge-base.md#elastic-docs).

### Anonymization [ai-assistant-anonymization]

::::{admonition} Requirements
To modify Anonymization settings, you need the **Elastic AI Assistant: All** privilege, with **Customize sub-feature privileges** enabled.

::::

The **Anonymization** tab of the Security AI settings menu allows you to define default data anonymization behavior for events you send to AI Assistant. Fields with **Allowed** toggled on are included in events provided to AI Assistant. **Allowed** fields with **Anonymized** set to **Yes** are included, but with their values obfuscated.

::::{note}
You can access anonymization settings directly from the **Attack Discovery** page by clicking the settings (![Settings icon](/solutions/images/security-icon-settings.png "title =20x20")) button next to the model selection dropdown menu.
::::

:::{image} /solutions/images/security-assistant-anonymization-menu.png
:alt: AI Assistant's settings menu
:screenshot:
:::

The fields on this list are among those most likely to provide relevant context to AI Assistant. Fields with **Allowed** toggled on are included. **Allowed** fields with **Anonymized** set to **Yes** are included, but with their values obfuscated.

The **Show anonymized** toggle controls whether you see the obfuscated or plaintext versions of the fields you sent to AI Assistant. It doesn’t control what gets obfuscated — that’s determined by the anonymization settings. It also doesn’t affect how event fields appear *before* being sent to AI Assistant. Instead, it controls how fields that were already sent and obfuscated appear to you.

When you include a particular event as context, such as an alert from the Alerts page, you can adjust anonymization behavior for the specific event. Be sure the anonymization behavior meets your specifications before sending a message with the event attached.

### Knowledge base [ai-assistant-page-knowledge-base]

The **Knowledge base** tab of the **Security AI settings** page allows you to enable AI Assistant to remember specified information, and use it as context to improve response quality. To learn more, refer to [AI Assistant Knowledge Base](/solutions/security/ai/ai-assistant-knowledge-base.md).

### Get the most from your queries [rag-for-esql]

Elastic AI Assistant allows you to take full advantage of the {{elastic-sec}} platform to improve your security operations. It can help you write an {{esql}} query for a particular use case, or answer general questions about how to use the platform. Its ability to assist you depends on the specificity and detail of your questions. The more context and detail you provide, the more tailored and useful its responses will be.

:::{note}
{applies_to}`stack: ga 9.1` {applies_to}`serverless: ga` The agent has access to index names and field metadata from your cluster. This contextual information helps improve ES|QL generation, though it may slightly increase response times.
:::

To maximize its usefulness, consider using more detailed prompts or asking for additional information. For instance, after asking for an {{esql}} query example, you could ask a follow-up question like, “Could you give me some other examples?” You can also ask for clarification or further exposition, for example "Provide comments explaining the query you just gave."

In addition to practical advice, AI Assistant can offer conceptual advice, tips, and best practices for enhancing your security measures. You can ask it, for example:

* “How do I set up a {{ml}} job in {{elastic-sec}} to detect anomalies in network traffic volume over time?”
* “I need to monitor for unusual file creation patterns that could indicate ransomware activity. How would I construct this query using EQL?”
