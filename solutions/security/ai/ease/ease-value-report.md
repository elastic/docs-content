# EASE Value Report

The **Value report** page estimates your savings from using Elastic AI SOC Engine (EASE) for alert triage, in terms of **Analyst time saved** and **Cost Savings**. The message at the top of the page explains how those numbers were determined, and how many alerts were **Escalated** and **Filtered** by AI. 

You can interact with the page in the following ways:

- **Update the time range:** Use the time selector in the upper right corner to select the time range for which to show value metrics.
- **Export report:** Select **Export report** in the upper right corner to download a sharable PDF of the value report.
