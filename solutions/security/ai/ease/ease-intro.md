# Elastic AI SOC Engine with {{sec-serverless}}

Elastic AI Security Operations Center (SOC) Engine (EASE) is an {{sec-serverless}} project type that provides AI-powered tools and case management to augment third-party SIEM and EDR/XDR platforms. This page describes how to create an {{sec-serverless}} EASE project, how to ingest your data, and how to use its key features.

## Create an EASE project

To create an EASE project:

1. [Create](/solutions/security/get-started/create-security-project.md) an {{sec-serverless}} project, and on the **Confirm your project settings** page, select **Elastic AI SOC Engine**.

   :::

2. Click **Create serverless project**, and wait for your project to be provisioned. When it's ready, open it.


## Ingest your SOC data

To ingest your SOC data: 

1. Go to the **Configurations** page using the navigation menu or the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).

    :::

2. From the **Integrations** tab, select any [integration](integration-docs://reference/index.md) you want to ingest data from to view deployment instructions and more information.

## Select a model

EASE uses LLM connectors to enable its AI features such as Attack Discovery and AI Assistant. The Elastic Managed LLM is enabled by default. You can also [create custom connectors](/solutions/security/ai/set-up-connectors-for-large-language-models-llm.md). Keep in mind that different models [perform differently](/solutions/security/ai/large-language-model-performance-matrix.md) on different tasks. 


## Features

EASE provides a set of capabilities designed to help make the most of each security analystâ€™s time, fight alert fatigue, and reduce your mean time to respond. Once your data is ingested, you can start using the following features:

- **[Attack Discovery](/solutions/security/ai/attack-discovery.md)**: Helps you analyze alerts in your environment and identify threats. Each discovery represents a potential attack and describes relationships among multiple alerts to tell you which users and hosts are involved, how alerts correspond to the MITRE ATT&CK matrix, and which threat actor might be responsible.

     :::

- **[AI Assistant](/solutions/security/ai/ai-assistant.md)**: An LLM-powered virtual assistant specialized for digital security; it helps with data analysis, alert investigation, incident response, and {{esql}} query generation. You can add custom background knowledge and data to its [knowledge base](/solutions/security/ai/ai-assistant-knowledge-base.md) and use natural language to ask for its assistance with your SOC operations.

- **[Cases](/solutions/security/investigate/cases.md)**: Helps you track and share related information about security issues. Track key investigation details and collect alerts in a central location.
