# Elastic AI SOC Engine

This page provides an overview of Elastic AI SOC Engine (EASE) and its key features. EASE is a {{serverless}} deployment type specialized to provide AI-powered tools and case management that can augment third-party SIEM and EDR platforms. 

## Get started with EASE

To create an EASE project:
1. [Create](security/get-started/create-security-project.md) a {{sec-serverless}} project, and on the **Confirm your project settings** page, select **Elastic AI SOC Engine**. 
2. Click **Create serverless project** and wait for your project to be provisioned. When it's ready, open it.
3. Use integrations to ingest your alerts to start working with Ease. 

## Features

Ease provides a set of capabilities designed to help make the most of each security analystâ€™s time, fight alert fatigue, and reduce your mean time to respond. Follow the documentation links below to learn more about each feature:

- **[Attack Discovery](/solutions/security/ai/attack-discovery.md)**: helps you analyze alerts in your environment and identify threats. Each discovery represents a potential attack and describes relationships among multiple alerts to tell you which users and hosts are involved, how alerts correspond to the MITRE ATT&CK matrix, and which threat actor might be responsible.

- **[AI Assistant](/solutions/security/ai/ai-assistant.md)**: an LLM powered virtual assistant specialized for digital security; it helps with data analysis, alert investigation, incident response, and {{esql}} query generation. You can add custom background knowledge and data to its [knowledge base](/solutions/security/ai/ai-assistant-knowledge-base.md), use natural language to ask for its assistance with your SOC operations, and much more.

- **[Cases](/solutions/security/investigate/cases.md)**: helps you track and share related information about security issues. Track key investigation details, collect alerts in a central location, and more.
