# Enable large language model (LLM) access

{{elastic-sec}} uses large language models (LLMs) for some of its advanced analytics features. To enable these features, you can connect a third-party LLM provider or a custom local LLM.

:::{important}
Different LLMs have varying performance when used to power different features and use-cases. For more information about how various models perform on different tasks in {{elastic-sec}}, refer to the [Large language model performance matrix](/solutions/security/ai/large-language-model-performance-matrix.md).

## Connect to a third-party LLM

Follow these guides to connect to one or more third-party LLM providers:

* [Azure OpenAI](/solutions/security/ai/connect-to-azure-openai.md)
* [Amazon Bedrock](/solutions/security/ai/connect-to-amazon-bedrock.md)
* [OpenAI](/solutions/security/ai/connect-to-openai.md)
* [Google Vertex](/solutions/security/ai/connect-to-google-vertex.md)

## Connect to a custom local LLM

You can [connect to LM Studio](/solutions/security/ai/connect-to-own-local-llm.md) to use a custom LLM deployed and managed by you.
