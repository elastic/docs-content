Elastic AI Assistant can help you learn about and leverage the Elasticsearch Query Language ({{esql}}) in many ways, including:

* **Education and training**: AI Assistant can serve as a powerful {{esql}} learning tool. Ask it for examples, explanations of complex queries, and best practices.
* **Writing new queries**: Prompt AI Assistant to provide a query that accomplishes a particular task, and it will generate a query matching your description. For example: "Write a query to identify documents with `curl.exe` usage and calculate the sum of `destination.bytes`" or "What query would return all user logins to [a host] in the last six hours?"
* **Providing feedback to optimize existing queries**: Send AI Assistant a query you want to work on and ask it for improvements, refactoring, a general assessment, or to optimize the queryâ€™s performance with large data sets.
* **Customizing queries for your environment**: Since each environment is unique, you may need to customize queries that you used in other contexts. AI Assistant can suggest necessary modifications based on contextual information you provide.
* **Troubleshooting**: Having trouble with a query or getting unexpected results? Ask AI Assistant to help you troubleshoot.

In these ways and others, AI Assistant can enable you to make use of {{esql}}'s advanced search capabilities to accomplish goals across {{elastic-sec}}.
