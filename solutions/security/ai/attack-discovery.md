% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/security-docs/security/attack-discovery.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/attack-discovery.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$attack-discovery-generate-discoveries$$$

$$$attack-discovery-what-info$$$

$$$attack-discovery-workflows$$$
