# Update your email address [ec-update-email-address]

Each {{ecloud}} account has a primary email associated with it. By default, the primary email address is used to sign up for {{ecloud}} and to log in. If needed, you can change this primary email address:

1. To edit your account settings, select the user icon on the header bar and select **Settings**.
2. In the **Email address** section, select **edit**.
3. Enter a new email address and your current password.

    An email is sent to the new address with a link to confirm the change. If you don’t get the email after a few minutes, check your spam folder.

If you are using Google or Microsoft Sign-In and would like to change your email address, you need to:

1. Go to the [Forgot password](https://cloud.elastic.co/forgot) page and enter your email address.
2. Follow the instructions in the "Reset your password" email.
3. In the [{{ecloud}} Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body), update your [User settings](https://cloud.elastic.co/user/settings) to the new email address.

If your organization is associated with [Azure Marketplace](../deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/azure-native-isv-service.md), you can’t change your primary email address using the above methods. Instead, [invite another user](../deploy-manage/users-roles/cloud-organization/manage-users.md) with the desired email address to your organization.
