# Change your password [ec-change-password]

If you created a password when you signed up for a {{ecloud}} account, or you added the password-based login method to your account, then you can change your password if needed.

If you know your current password:

1. Log in to the [{{ecloud}} Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
2. Open the user menu in the header bar.
3. Go to **Profile**.
4. Select **Change password**.
5. Enter the current password and provide the new password that you want to use.

If you don’t know your current password:

1. At the login screen for the [{{ecloud}} Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body), select the link **Forgot password?**.
2. Enter the primary email address for your account and select **Reset password**.

    By default, to sign up for {{ecloud}} you use your primary email address. If you change it at some point, use your current email address to log in to {{ecloud}}.

    An email is sent to the address you specified with a link to reset the password. If you don’t get the email after a few minutes, check your spam folder.
