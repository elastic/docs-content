# Change your password [ec-change-password]

If you created a password when you signed up for a Elasticsearch Service account, or you added the password-based login method to your account, then you can change your password if needed.

If you know your current password:

1. Log in to the [Elasticsearch Service Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
2. Open the user menu in the header bar.
3. Go to **Profile**.
4. Select **Change password**.
5. Enter the current password and provide the new password that you want to use.

If you don’t know your current password:

1. At the login screen for the [Elasticsearch Service Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body), select the link **Forgot password?**.
2. Enter the primary email address for your account and select **Reset password**.

    By default, to sign up for Elasticsearch Service you use your primary email address. If you change it at some point, use your current email address to log in to Elasticsearch Service.

    An email is sent to the address you specified with a link to reset the password. If you don’t get the email after a few minutes, check your spam folder.
