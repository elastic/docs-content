# Manage your Cloud account

Your {{ecloud}} account allows you to manage your personal settings, including your email address, password, and authentication methods. You can perform the following tasks at any time from your user profile:

* [Update your email address](/cloud-account/update-your-email-address.md)
* [Add an additional login method](/cloud-account/add-a-login-method.md): Choose from password-based login, Google sign-in, and Microsoft sign-in.

If you use password-based login, then you can perform the following additional tasks:

* [Change your password](/cloud-account/change-your-password.md)
* [Configure multifactor authentication](/cloud-account/multifactor-authentication.md)

Additionally, you can manage your organization membership, including joining or leaving an organization. Refer to [Join or leave an organization](/cloud-account/join-or-leave-an-organization.md) for more information.

::::{tip} 
This section focuses on the actions you can take as an individual user to manage your own account. It does not cover organization-wide settings, such as managing user permissions or configuring organization-level access controls, which are handled by the organization administrators.

For information on organization and access management, refer to:
- [Manage your Cloud organization](/deploy-manage/cloud-organization.md)
- [Manage user roles and permissions](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cloud-organization/user-roles.md)
