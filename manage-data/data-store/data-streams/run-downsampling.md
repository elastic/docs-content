# Downsample time series data [running-downsampling]

To downsample a time series data stream (TSDS), you can use index lifecycle management (ILM) or a data stream lifecycle. (You can also use the [downsample API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-downsample) with an individual time series index, but most users don't need to use the API.)

Before you begin, review the [](downsampling-concepts.md).

:::{important}
Downsampling requires **read-only** data.
:::

In most cases, you can choose the data stream lifecycle option. If you're using [data tiers](/manage-data/lifecycle/data-tiers.md) in {{stack}}, choose the index lifecycle option.

## Downsample with a data stream lifecycle
```{applies_to}
stack: ga
serverless: ga
```

To downsample a time series via a data stream lifecycle, add a [downsampling](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-put-data-lifecycle) section to the lifecycle. 

* Set `fixed_interval` to your preferred level of granularity. The original time series data will be aggregated at this interval.
* Set `after` to the minimum time to wait after an index rollover, before running downsampling.

```console
PUT _data_stream/my-data-stream/_lifecycle
{
  "data_retention": "7d",
  "downsampling": [
     {
       "after": "1m",
       "fixed_interval": "10m"
      },
      {
        "after": "1d",
        "fixed_interval": "1h"
      }
   ]
}
```

The downsampling action runs after the [index time series end time](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/index-settings/time-series.md#index-time-series-end-time) has passed.

## Downsampling with index lifecycle management
```{applies_to}
stack: ga
serverless: unavailable
```

To downsample time series data as part of index lifecycle management (ILM), include  [downsample actions](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/index-lifecycle-actions/ilm-downsample.md) in your ILM policy. You can configure multiple downsampling actions across different phases to progressively reduce data granularity over time.

This example shows a policy with rollover and two downsampling actions: one in the hot phase for initial aggregation at 5-minute intervals, and another in the warm phase for further aggregation at 1-hour intervals:

```console
PUT _ilm/policy/datastream_policy
{
  "policy": {
    "phases": {
      "hot": {
        "actions": {
          "rollover" : {
            "max_age": "5m"
          },
          "downsample": {
  	        "fixed_interval": "5m"
  	      }
        }
      },
      "warm": {
        "actions": {
          "downsample": {
            "fixed_interval": "1h"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Set `fixed_interval` to your preferred level of granularity. The original time series data will be aggregated at this interval. The downsample action runs after the index is rolled over and the [index time series end time](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/index-settings/time-series.md#index-time-series-end-time) has passed.

% Set `fixed_interval` to your preferred level of granularity. The original time series data will be aggregated at this interval.
