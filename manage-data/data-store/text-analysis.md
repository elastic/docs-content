# Text analysis

% What needs to be done: Refine

% GitHub issue: docs-projects#371

% Scope notes: Combine the linked sources into a single intro/overview and add links to the relevant reference pages.

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/analysis.md
%      Notes: Introduce analysis plugins, placed here because in an indexing context it's called from the mapping or the index settings, you can also call it from search but maybe we can just reference it in the context of the search API
