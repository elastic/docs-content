# Use a data stream [use-a-data-stream]

After you [set up a data stream](set-up-data-stream.md), you can do the following:

* [Add documents to a data stream](#add-documents-to-a-data-stream)
* [Search a data stream](#search-a-data-stream)
* [Get statistics for a data stream](#get-stats-for-a-data-stream)
* [Manually roll over a data stream](#manually-roll-over-a-data-stream)
* [Open closed backing indices](#open-closed-backing-indices)
* [Reindex with a data stream](#reindex-with-a-data-stream)
* [Update documents in a data stream by query](#update-docs-in-a-data-stream-by-query)
* [Delete documents in a data stream by query](#delete-docs-in-a-data-stream-by-query)
* [Update or delete documents in a backing index](#update-delete-docs-in-a-backing-index)


## Add documents to a data stream [add-documents-to-a-data-stream] 

To add an individual document, use the [index API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-create). [Ingest pipelines](../../ingest/transform-enrich/ingest-pipelines.md) are supported.

```console
POST /my-data-stream/_doc/
{
  "@timestamp": "2099-03-08T11:06:07.000Z",
  "user": {
    "id": "8a4f500d"
  },
  "message": "Login successful"
}
```

You cannot add new documents to a data stream using the index API’s `PUT /<target>/_doc/<_id>` request format. To specify a document ID, use the `PUT /<target>/_create/<_id>` format instead. Only an [`op_type`](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-create#docs-index-api-op_type) of `create` is supported.

To add multiple documents with a single request, use the [bulk API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-bulk). Only `create` actions are supported.

```console
PUT /my-data-stream/_bulk?refresh
{"create":{ }}
{ "@timestamp": "2099-03-08T11:04:05.000Z", "user": { "id": "vlb44hny" }, "message": "Login attempt failed" }
{"create":{ }}
{ "@timestamp": "2099-03-08T11:06:07.000Z", "user": { "id": "8a4f500d" }, "message": "Login successful" }
{"create":{ }}
{ "@timestamp": "2099-03-09T11:07:08.000Z", "user": { "id": "l7gk7f82" }, "message": "Logout successful" }
```


## Search a data stream [search-a-data-stream] 

The following search APIs support data streams:

* [Search](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-search)
* [Async search](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-async-search-submit)
* [Multi search](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-msearch)
* [Field capabilities](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-field-caps)
* [EQL search](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-eql-search)


## Get statistics for a data stream [get-stats-for-a-data-stream] 

Use the [data stream stats API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-data-streams-stats-1) to get statistics for one or more data streams:

```console
GET /_data_stream/my-data-stream/_stats?human=true
```


## Manually roll over a data stream [manually-roll-over-a-data-stream] 

Use the [rollover API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-rollover) to manually [roll over](data-streams.md#data-streams-rollover) a data stream. You have two options when manually rolling over:

1. To immediately trigger a rollover:

    ```console
    POST /my-data-stream/_rollover/
    ```

2. Or to postpone the rollover until the next indexing event occurs:

    ```console
    POST /my-data-stream/_rollover?lazy
    ```

    Use the second to avoid having empty backing indices in data streams that do not get updated often.



## Open closed backing indices [open-closed-backing-indices] 

You cannot search a [closed](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-close) backing index, even by searching its data stream. You also cannot [update](#update-docs-in-a-data-stream-by-query) or [delete](#delete-docs-in-a-data-stream-by-query) documents in a closed index.

To re-open a closed backing index, submit an [open index API request](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-open) directly to the index:

```console
POST /.ds-my-data-stream-2099.03.07-000001/_open/
```

To re-open all closed backing indices for a data stream, submit an open index API request to the stream:

```console
POST /my-data-stream/_open/
```


## Reindex with a data stream [reindex-with-a-data-stream] 

Use the [reindex API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-reindex) to copy documents from an existing index, alias, or data stream to a data stream. Because data streams are [append-only](data-streams.md#data-streams-append-only), a reindex into a data stream must use an `op_type` of `create`. A reindex cannot update existing documents in a data stream.

```console
POST /_reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "archive"
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "my-data-stream",
    "op_type": "create"
  }
}
```


## Update documents in a data stream by query [update-docs-in-a-data-stream-by-query] 

Use the [update by query API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-update-by-query) to update documents in a data stream that match a provided query:

```console
POST /my-data-stream/_update_by_query
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "user.id": "l7gk7f82"
    }
  },
  "script": {
    "source": "ctx._source.user.id = params.new_id",
    "params": {
      "new_id": "XgdX0NoX"
    }
  }
}
```


## Delete documents in a data stream by query [delete-docs-in-a-data-stream-by-query] 

Use the [delete by query API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-delete-by-query) to delete documents in a data stream that match a provided query:

```console
POST /my-data-stream/_delete_by_query
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "user.id": "vlb44hny"
    }
  }
}
```


## Update or delete documents in a backing index [update-delete-docs-in-a-backing-index] 

If needed, you can update or delete documents in a data stream by sending requests to the backing index containing the document. You’ll need:

* The [document ID](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-id-field.html)
* The name of the backing index containing the document
* If updating the document, its [sequence number and primary term](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/optimistic-concurrency-control.html)

To get this information, use a [search request](#search-a-data-stream):

```console
GET /my-data-stream/_search
{
  "seq_no_primary_term": true,
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "user.id": "yWIumJd7"
    }
  }
}
```

Response:

```console-result
{
  "took": 20,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 3,
    "successful": 3,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": {
      "value": 1,
      "relation": "eq"
    },
    "max_score": 0.2876821,
    "hits": [
      {
        "_index": ".ds-my-data-stream-2099.03.08-000003",      <1>
        "_id": "bfspvnIBr7VVZlfp2lqX",              <2>
        "_seq_no": 0,                               <3>
        "_primary_term": 1,                         <4>
        "_score": 0.2876821,
        "_source": {
          "@timestamp": "2099-03-08T11:06:07.000Z",
          "user": {
            "id": "yWIumJd7"
          },
          "message": "Login successful"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

1. Backing index containing the matching document
2. Document ID for the document
3. Current sequence number for the document
4. Primary term for the document


To update the document, use an [index API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-create) request with valid `if_seq_no` and `if_primary_term` arguments:

```console
PUT /.ds-my-data-stream-2099-03-08-000003/_doc/bfspvnIBr7VVZlfp2lqX?if_seq_no=0&if_primary_term=1
{
  "@timestamp": "2099-03-08T11:06:07.000Z",
  "user": {
    "id": "8a4f500d"
  },
  "message": "Login successful"
}
```

To delete the document, use the [delete API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-delete):

```console
DELETE /.ds-my-data-stream-2099.03.08-000003/_doc/bfspvnIBr7VVZlfp2lqX
```

To delete or update multiple documents with a single request, use the [bulk API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-bulk)'s `delete`, `index`, and `update` actions. For `index` actions, include valid [`if_seq_no` and `if_primary_term`](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-bulk#bulk-optimistic-concurrency-control) arguments.

```console
PUT /_bulk?refresh
{ "index": { "_index": ".ds-my-data-stream-2099.03.08-000003", "_id": "bfspvnIBr7VVZlfp2lqX", "if_seq_no": 0, "if_primary_term": 1 } }
{ "@timestamp": "2099-03-08T11:06:07.000Z", "user": { "id": "8a4f500d" }, "message": "Login successful" }
```
