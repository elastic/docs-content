# Manage a data stream [index-management-manage-data-streams]

Investigate your data streams and address lifecycle management needs in the **Data Streams** view.

The value in the **Indices** column indicates the number of backing indices. Click this number to drill down into details.

A value in the data retention column indicates that the data stream is managed by a data stream lifecycle policy. This value is the time period for which your data is guaranteed to be stored. Data older than this period can be deleted by {{es}} at a later time.

In {{es-serverless}}, indices matching the `logs-*-*` pattern use the logsDB index mode by default. The logsDB index mode creates a [logs data stream](../../../manage-data/data-store/index-types/logs-data-stream.md).
