# Index basics

% What needs to be done: Refine

% GitHub issue: docs-projects#369

% Scope notes: Combine content from linked sources.

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/documents-indices.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/index-mgmt.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/index-management.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):
