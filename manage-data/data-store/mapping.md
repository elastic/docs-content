# Mapping

% What needs to be done: Refine

% GitHub issue: docs-projects#370

% Scope notes: Use the content in the linked source and add links to the relevent reference content.

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/mapping.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/index-modules-mapper.md
%      Notes: redirect only

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$mapping-limit-settings$$$

$$$updating-field-mappings$$$

$$$mapping-manage-update$$$

$$$mapping-dynamic$$$

$$$mapping-explicit$$$
