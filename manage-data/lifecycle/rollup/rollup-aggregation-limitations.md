::::{admonition} Deprecated in 8.11.0.

There are some limitations to how fields can be rolled up / aggregated. This page highlights the major limitations so that you are aware of them.


## Limited aggregation components [_limited_aggregation_components]

* Date Histogram aggregation
* Histogram aggregation
* Terms aggregation

And the following metrics are allowed to be specified for numeric fields:

* Min aggregation
* Max aggregation
