# Manually apply a lifecycle policy to an index [apply-policy-manually]

When you create new {{es}} index you can use an index template to apply the lifecycle policy by which the index will be managed. This process is described in [Configure a lifecycle policy](/manage-data/lifecycle/index-lifecycle-management/configure-lifecycle-policy.md).

You can also manually apply a lifecycle policy to an existing index, as described on this page. If an index is currently managed by an ILM policy you must first remove that policy before applying a new one. Refer to [Switch to a different lifecycle policy](/manage-data/lifecycle/index-lifecycle-management/policy-updates.md#switch-lifecycle-policies) for details.

You can do this procedure in {{kib}} or using the {{es}} API.

::::{warning}
Do not manually apply a policy that uses the rollover action. Policies that use rollover must be applied by the [index template](/manage-data/lifecycle/index-lifecycle-management/configure-lifecycle-policy.md#apply-policy-template). Otherwise, the policy is not carried forward when the rollover action creates a new index.

To apply a lifecycle policy to an existing index:

1. Go to **Stack Management > Index Management**. In the **Indices** tab, search for and select an index. Enable **Include hidden indices** to see the full list of indices.

1. From the **Manage index** dropdown menu select **Add lifecycle policy**.

1. Choose a lifecycle policy and confirm your changes.

:::{tab-item} API
:sync: api
Use the [update settings API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-put-settings) to apply a lifecycle policy to an index.

```console
PUT my-index/_settings
{
  "index": {
    "lifecycle": {
      "name": "my_ilm_policy"
    }
  }
}
```

You can apply the same policy to multiple indices by using wildcards in the index name when you call the API.

```console
PUT my-indices*/_settings
{
  "index": {
    "lifecycle": {
      "name": "my_ilm_policy"
    }
  }
}
```

::::::{warning}
Be careful not to inadvertently match indices that you donâ€™t want to modify.
::::::

Once the policy is applied, {{ilm-init}} starts managing the index immediately.
