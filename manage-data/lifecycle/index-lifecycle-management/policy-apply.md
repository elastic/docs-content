# Manually apply a lifecycle policy to an index [apply-policy-manually]

When you create a new {{es}} index, it automatically picks up settings, mappings, and aliases from any matching [index template](/manage-data/data-store/templates.md#index-templates) and its component templates. If the template specifies a lifecycle policy, that policy is applied to the new index as soon as it's created so that the index will be managed by {{ilm-init}}. This process is described in detail in [Configure a lifecycle policy](/manage-data/lifecycle/index-lifecycle-management/configure-lifecycle-policy.md).

You can also apply a lifecycle policy manually to existing indices that are not yet managed, as described on this page. This is useful if you want to:
 * Configure the indices to move through different [data tiers](/manage-data/lifecycle/data-tiers.md) as they age.
 * Perform [lifecycle actions](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/index-lifecycle-actions/index.md) such as downsampling or shrinking.
 * Delete the indices when they reach a certain age.

:::{warning}
Consider the following before manually applying a policy to an index:

* If an index is currently managed by an ILM policy you must first remove that policy before applying a new one. To remove or make changes to an {{ilm-init}} policy currently applied to one or more indices, or to switch indices to use a different policy, refer to [Update or switch a lifecycle policy](/manage-data/lifecycle/index-lifecycle-management/policy-updates.md).
* Do not manually apply a policy that uses the rollover action. Policies that use rollover must be applied by the [index template](/manage-data/lifecycle/index-lifecycle-management/configure-lifecycle-policy.md#apply-policy-template). Otherwise, the policy is not carried forward when the rollover action creates a new index. For an approach to migrating existing indices that supports rollover, refer to [](/manage-data/lifecycle/index-lifecycle-management/migrate-ilm.md).

You can do this procedure in {{kib}} or using the {{es}} API.

::::{tab-set}
:group: kibana-api
:::{tab-item} {{kib}}
:sync: kibana

To apply a lifecycle policy to an existing index:

1. Go to **Stack Management > Index Management**. In the **Indices** tab, search for and select an index. Enable **Include hidden indices** to see the full list of indices.

1. From the **Manage index** dropdown menu select **Add lifecycle policy**.

1. Choose a lifecycle policy and confirm your changes.

:::{tab-item} API
:sync: api
Use the [update settings API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-put-settings) to apply a lifecycle policy to an index.

```console
PUT my-index/_settings
{
  "index": {
    "lifecycle": {
      "name": "my_ilm_policy"
    }
  }
}
```

You can apply the same policy to multiple indices by using wildcards in the index name when you call the API.

```console
PUT my-indices*/_settings
{
  "index": {
    "lifecycle": {
      "name": "my_ilm_policy"
    }
  }
}
```

::::::{warning}
Be careful not to inadvertently match indices that you donâ€™t want to modify.
::::::

Once the policy is applied, {{ilm-init}} starts managing the index immediately.
