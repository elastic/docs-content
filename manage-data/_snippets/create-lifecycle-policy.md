A lifecycle policy specifies the phases in the index lifecycle and the actions to perform in each phase. A lifecycle can have up to five phases: `hot`, `warm`, `cold`, `frozen`, and `delete`.

For example, you might define a policy named `timeseries_policy` that has the following two phases:

* A `hot` phase that defines a rollover action to specify that an index rolls over when it reaches either a `max_primary_shard_size` of 50 gigabytes or a `max_age` of 30 days.
* A `delete` phase that sets `min_age` to remove the index 90 days after rollover.

::::{note}
The `min_age` value is relative to the rollover time, not the index creation time. [Learn more](../../troubleshoot/elasticsearch/index-lifecycle-management-errors.md#min-age-calculation).

You can create the policy in {{kib}} or with the [create or update policy](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-ilm-put-lifecycle) API. 

::::{tab-set}
:group: kibana-api
:::{tab-item} {{kib}}

To create the policy from {{kib}}, open the menu and go to **Stack Management > Index Lifecycle Policies**. Click **Create policy**.

:::{tab-item} API
:sync: api
Use the [Create or update policy](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-ilm-put-lifecycle) API to add an ILM policy to the {{es}} cluster:

```console
PUT _ilm/policy/timeseries_policy
{
  "policy": {
    "phases": {
      "hot": {                                <1>
        "actions": {
          "rollover": {
            "max_primary_shard_size": "50GB", <2>
            "max_age": "30d"
          }
        }
      },
      "delete": {
        "min_age": "90d",                     <3>
        "actions": {
          "delete": {}                        <4>
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

1. The `min_age` defaults to `0ms`, so new indices enter the `hot` phase immediately.
2. Trigger the `rollover` action when either of the conditions are met.
3. Move the index into the `delete` phase 90 days after rollover.
4. Trigger the `delete` action when the index enters the delete phase.
