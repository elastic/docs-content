[Beats](beats://reference/index.md) are the original Elastic lightweight data shippers, and their capabilities live on in Elastic Agent. When you use Elastic Agent, you’re getting core Beats functionality, but with more added features.

Beats require that you install a separate Beat for each type of data you want to collect. A single Elastic Agent installed on a host can collect and transport multiple types of data.
