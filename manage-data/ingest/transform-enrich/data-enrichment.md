# Data enrichment

% What needs to be done: Lift-and-shift

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/ingest-enriching-data.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/index-mgmt.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$enrich-index$$$

$$$enrich-policy$$$
