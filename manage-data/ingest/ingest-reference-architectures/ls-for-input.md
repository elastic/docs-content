# Logstash to Elasticsearch [ls-for-input]

:::{image} ../../../images/ingest-ls-es.png
:alt: Image showing {{ls}} collecting data and sending to {{es}}
:::

Ingest model
:   {{ls}} to collect data from sources not currently supported by {{agent}} and sending the data to {{es}}. Note that the data transformation still happens within the {{es}} ingest pipeline.

Use when
:   {{agent}} doesnâ€™t currently support your data source.

Examples
:   AWS Kinesis, databases, Kafka
