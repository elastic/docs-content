# Elastic Agent to Logstash (for enrichment) to Elasticsearch [ls-enrich]

:::{image} ../../../images/ingest-ea-ls-enrich.png
:alt: Image showing {{agent}} collecting data
:::

Ingest models
:   * {{agent}} to {{es}} using {{ls}} to enrich the data
* {{agent}} to {{ls}} for enrichment based on fields in the {{agent}} data to {{es}}


Use when
:   * Data enrichment in {{es}} is not practical for business or technical reasons
* Your use case requires data enrichment based on fields in the {{agent}} data. {{ls}} can collect enrichment data based on those fields, and then send the data to {{es}}.


Examples
:   * Data that changes frequently and is updated using an external source, such as stock ticker data
* Enrichment data is proprietary and cannot be stored elsewhere.
* Enrichment is done with an HTTP API whose return depends on values from the document.<br> Example: An API that takes geo points with the collected data and returns available real estate in the region, and then passes to {{ls}} enrichment for enrichment between agents and {{es}}.
