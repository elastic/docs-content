:::

Ingest model
:   Control path: {{agent}} to {{fleet}} to {{es}}<br> Data path: {{agent}} to {{ls}} to Kafka to Kafka ES Sink to {{es}}: Kafka as middleware message queue.

    Kafka ES Sink connector reads from Kafka and writes to {{es}}.

:   You are standardizing on Kafka as middleware message queue between {{agent}} and {{es}}

Notes
