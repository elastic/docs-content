::::{tip}
This architecture works with a variety of proxying tools to allow for more flexibility in your environment. Consider using [{{ls}} as a proxy](ls-networkbridge.md), as {{ls}} and the rest of the {{stack}} are designed and tested to work together, and can be easier to support.
::::


Ingest model
:   <br> Control path for {{fleet-server}} on {{ecloud}}: {{agent}} to proxy to {{fleet-server}} to {{es}}<br> Control path for self-managed {{fleet-server}}: {{agent}} to {{fleet-server}} to proxy to {{es}}<br> Data path: {{agent}} to proxy to {{es}}

Use when
:   * Network restrictions prevent connection between {{agent}} network and network where {{fleet-server}} and {{stack}} are deployed, as when {{fleet-server}} is deployed on {{ecloud}}
* Network restrictions prevent connection between {{agent}} and {{fleet-server}} network and the network where {{stack}} is deployed, as when {{stack}} is deployed on {{ecloud}}
* Using [{{ls}} as proxy](ls-networkbridge.md) is not feasible.


Currently {{agent}} is not able to present a certificate for connectivity to {{fleet-server}}. Therefore if a proxy placed between the {{agent}} and {{fleet-server}} is configured for mutual TLS, {{agents}} wonâ€™t be able to establish connectivity to {{fleet server}}.
