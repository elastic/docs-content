# Elastic Agent to Logstash to Elasticsearch: Logstash as a proxy [ls-networkbridge]

:::{image} ../../../images/ingest-ea-ls-bridge.png
:alt: Image showing {{agent}}s collecting data and sending to {{ls}} for proxying before sending on to {es}
:::

Ingest model
:   Data path: {{agent}} to {{ls}} as bridge to {{es}} on {{stack}} network<br> Control path: {{agent}} to {{fleet-server}} to {es}

Use when
:   Agents have network restrictions for connecting to {{es}} on {{stack}} deployed outside of the agent network

Example
:   You can send data from multiple {{agent}}s through your demilitarized zone (DMZ) to {{ls}}, and then use {{ls}} as a proxy through your firewall to {{ess}}. This approach helps reduce the number of firewall exceptions needed to forward data from large numbers of {{agent}}s.
