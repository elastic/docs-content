# Ingest data with Python on Elasticsearch Service

% What needs to be done: Refine

% Scope notes: Merge ESS and ECE versions (should be pretty much identical)

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud/ec-getting-started-python.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud-enterprise/ece-getting-started-python.md
