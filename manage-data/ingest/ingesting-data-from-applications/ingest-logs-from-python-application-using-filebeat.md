# Ingest logs from a Python application using Filebeat

% What needs to be done: Refine

% Scope notes: Merge ESS and ECE versions (should be pretty much identical)

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud/ec-getting-started-search-use-cases-python-logs.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud-enterprise/ece-getting-started-search-use-cases-python-logs.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):
