Elastic Learned Sparse EncodeR - or ELSER - is a retrieval model trained by
Elastic that enables you to perform
{ref}/semantic-search-elser.html[semantic search] to retrieve more relevant
search results. This search type provides you search results based on contextual
meaning and user intent, rather than exact keyword matches.

ELSER is an out-of-domain model which means it does not require fine-tuning on
your own data, making it adaptable for various use cases out of the box.

ELSER expands the indexed and searched passages into collections of terms that
are learned to co-occur frequently within a diverse set of training data. The
terms that the text is expanded into by the model _are not_ synonyms for the
search terms; they are learned associations. These expanded terms are weighted
as some of them are more significant than others. Then the {es}
{ref}/rank-feature.html[rank-feature field type] is used to store the terms
and weights at index time, and to search against later.

[[requirements]]
== Requirements

To use ELSER, you must have the {subscriptions}[appropriate subscription] level
for semantic search or the trial period activated.

[[benchmarks]]
== Benchmarks

The following sections provide information about how ELSER performs on different
hardwares and compares the model performance to {es} BM25 and other strong
baselines such as Splade or OpenAI.

[[hardware-benchmarks]]
=== Hardware benchmarks

Two data sets were utilized to evaluate the performance of ELSER in different
hardware configurations: `msmarco-long-light` and `arguana`.

|===
| | | |

| **Data set**
| **Data set size**
| **Average count of tokens / query**
| **Average count of tokens / document**

| `msmarco-long-light`
| 37367 documents
| 9
| 1640

| `arguana`
| 8674 documents
| 238
| 202
|===

The `msmarco-long-light` data set contains long documents with an average of
over 512 tokens, which provides insights into the performance implications
of indexing and {infer} time for long documents. This is a subset of the
"msmarco" dataset specifically designed for document retrieval (it shouldn't be
confused with the "msmarco" dataset used for passage retrieval, which primarily
consists of shorter spans of text).

The `arguana` data set is a https://github.com/beir-cellar/beir[BEIR] data set.
It consists of long queries with an average of 200 tokens per query. It can
represent an upper limit for query slowness.

The table below present benchmarking results for ELSER using various hardware
configurations.

[discrete]
[[qualitative-benchmarks]]
=== Qualitative benchmarks

The metric that is used to evaluate ELSER's ranking ability is the Normalized
Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) which can handle multiple relevant documents
and fine-grained document ratings. The metric is applied to a fixed-sized list
of retrieved documents which, in this case, is the top 10 documents (NDCG@10).

The table below shows the performance of ELSER compared to {es} BM25 with an
English analyzer broken down by the 12 data sets used for the evaluation. ELSER
has 10 wins, 1 draw, 1 loss and an average improvement in NDCG@10 of 17%.

_NDCG@10 for BEIR data sets for BM25 and ELSER  - higher values are better)_

The following table compares the average performance of ELSER to some other
strong baselines. The OpenAI results are separated out because they use a
different subset of the BEIR suite.

_Average NDCG@10 for BEIR data sets vs. various high quality baselines (higher_
_is better). OpenAI chose a different subset, ELSER results on this set_
_reported separately._

[[download-and-deploy-elser]]
== Download and deploy ELSER

You can download and deploy ELSER either from **Trained Models** or by using the
Dev Console.

[discrete]
[[using-the-trained-models-page]]
=== Using the Trained Models page

. In {kib}, navigate to **Trained Models**. ELSER can be found
in the list of trained models.
. Click the **Download model** button under **Actions**. You can check the
download status on the **Notifications** page.
+

. After the download is finished, start the deployment by clicking the
**Start deployment** button.
. Provide a deployment ID, select the priority, and set the number of
allocations and threads per allocation values.
+

. Click Start.

[discrete]
[[using-the-dev-console]]
=== Using the Dev Console

. Navigate to the **Dev Console**.
. Create the ELSER model configuration by running the following API call:
+
[source,console]
----
PUT _ml/trained_models/.elser_model_1
{
"input": {
&#x9;"field_names": ["text_field"]
}

----
+
The API call automatically initiates the model download if the model is not
downloaded yet.
. Deploy the model by using the
{ref}/start-trained-model-deployment.html[start trained model deployment API]
with a delpoyment ID:
+
[source,console]
----
POST _ml/trained_models/.elser_model_1/deployment/_start?deployment_id=for_search
----
+
You can deploy the model multiple times with different deployment IDs.

After the deployment is complete, ELSER is ready to use either in an ingest
pipeline or in a `sparse_vector` query to perform semantic search.
