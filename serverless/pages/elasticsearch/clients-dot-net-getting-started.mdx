This page guides you through the installation process of the
.NET client for ((es3)), shows you how to initialize the client, and how to perform basic
((es)) operations with it.


## Requirements

* .NET Core, .NET 5+ or .NET Framework (4.6.1 and higher).


## Installation

You can install the .NET client with the following command:

```bash
dotnet add package Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch.Serverless
```


## Initialize the client

Initialize the client using your API key and Elasticsearch Endpoint:

```net
var client = new ElasticsearchClient("<CLOUD_ID>", new ApiKey("<API_KEY>"));
```

To get API keys or the Elasticsearch Endpoint for a project, see <DocLink slug="/serverless/elasticsearch/get-started" />.


## Using the API

After you've initialized the client, you can create an index and start ingesting
documents.


### Creating an index and ingesting documents

The following is an example of creating a `my_index` index:

```net
var response = await client.Indices.CreateAsync("my_index");
```

This is a simple way of indexing a document into `my_index`:

```net
var doc = new MyDoc
{
    Id = 1,
    User = "xyz_user",
    Message = "Trying out the client, so far so good?"
};

var response = await client.IndexAsync(doc, "my_index");
```


### Getting documents

You can get documents by using the following code:

```net
var response = await client.GetAsync<MyDoc>(id, idx => idx.Index("my_index"));

if (response.IsValidResponse)
{
    var doc = response.Source;
}
```


### Searching

This is how you can create a single match query with the .NET client:

```net
var response = await client.SearchAsync<MyDoc>(s => s
    .Index("my_index")
    .From(0)
    .Size(10)
    .Query(q => q
        .Term(t => t.User, "flobernd")
    )
);

if (response.IsValidResponse)
{
    var doc = response.Documents.FirstOrDefault();
}
```


### Updating a document

This is how you can update a document, for example to add a new field:

```net
doc.Message = "This is a new message";

var response = await client.UpdateAsync<MyDoc, MyDoc>("my_index", 1, u => u
    .Doc(doc));
```

### Deleting a document

```net
var response = await client.DeleteAsync("my_index", 1);
```


### Deleting an index


```net
var response = await client.Indices.DeleteAsync("my_index");
```
