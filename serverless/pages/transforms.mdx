((transforms-cap)) enable you to convert existing ((es)) indices into summarized
indices, which provide opportunities for new insights and analytics.

For example, you can use ((transforms)) to pivot your data into entity-centric
indices that summarize the behavior of users or sessions or other entities in
your data. Or you can use ((transforms)) to find the latest document among all the
documents that have a certain unique key.

## Create and manage ((transforms))

In **((project-settings)) → ((manage-app)) → ((transforms-app))**, you can
create, edit, stop, start, reset, and delete ((transforms)):

When you create a ((transform)), you must choose between two types: _pivot_ and _latest_.
You must also decide whether you want the ((transform)) to run once or continuously.
