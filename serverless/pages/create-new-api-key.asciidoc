= Create a new API key

Create an API key, which will enable you to access the {es} API to ingest and search data.

. On the **Getting Started** page, scroll to **Add an API Key** and select **New**.
. In **Create API Key**, enter a name for your key and (optionally) set an expiration date.
. (Optional) Under **Control Security privileges**, you can set specific access permissions for this API key. By default, it has full access to all APIs.
. (Optional) The **Add metadata** section allows you to add custom key-value pairs to help identify and organize your API keys.
. Select **Create API Key** to finish.

After creation, you'll see your API key displayed as an encoded string.
Store this encoded API key securely. It is displayed only once and cannot be retrieved later.
You will use this encoded API key when sending API requests.

[NOTE]
====
You can't recover or retrieve a lost API key. Instead, you must delete the key and create a new one.
