[[elasticsearch-follow-guided-index-flowt]]
== Option 1 - Follow the guided index flow

Once your project is set up, you'll be directed to a page where you can create your first index. 
An index is where documents are stored and organized, making it possible to search and retrieve data.

. Enter a name for your index.
. Click *Create my index*. You can also create the index by clicking on *Code* to view and run code through the command line.

. You’ll be directed to the *Index Management* page. Here, copy and save the following:
- Elasticsearch URL
- API key

[NOTE]
====
You won’t be able to view this API key again. If needed, refer to <<elasticsearch-get-started-create-api-key,Create a new API key>> to generate a new one.

The UI provides ready-to-use code examples for ingesting data via the REST API. 
Choose your preferred tool for making these requests:

* Elastic Console in your project's UI
* Python 
* JavaScript 
* cURL

[[elasticsearch-explore-on-your-own]]
== Option 3 - Explore on your own

. Retrieve your <<elasticsearch-connecting-to-es-serverless-endpoint,connection details>>.
. Ingest your data. Elasticsearch provides several methods for ingesting data:
* <<elasticsearch-ingest-data-through-api,{es} API>>
* <<elasticsearch-ingest-data-through-integrations-connector-client,Connector clients>>
* <<elasticsearch-ingest-data-file-upload,File Uploader>>
* <<elasticsearch-ingest-data-through-beats,{beats}>>
* <<elasticsearch-ingest-data-through-logstash,{ls}>>
* https://github.com/elastic/crawler[Elastic Open Web Crawler]

For more information on data ingestion and synchronization, 
see <<elasticsearch-ingest-your-data>>. 

Once your data is ingested, experiment with <<elasticsearch-playground,Playground>> to test queries and explore features.

To learn about the search API and query DSL, refer to <<elasticsearch-http-apis>>.
