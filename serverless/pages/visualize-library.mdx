The **Visualize Library** is a space where you can save visualization panels that you may want to use across multiple dashboards. The **Visualize Library** consists of two pages:

* **Visualizations**
* **Annotation groups**

## Visualizations

By default the **Visualizations** page opens first. Here you can create new visualizations, or select from a list of previously created visualizations. To learn more, refer to <DocLink slug="/serverless/elasticsearch/explore-your-data-visualizations" section="save-to-the-visualize-library">save to the Visualize Library</DocLink>.

## Annotation groups

**Annotation groups** give you the option to mark points on a visualization panel with events, such as a deployment, to help track performance. These annotations can be reused across multiple visualization panels.
