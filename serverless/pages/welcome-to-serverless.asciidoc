Elastic serverless products allow you to deploy and use Elastic for your use cases without managing the underlying Elastic cluster,
such as nodes, data tiers, and scaling. Serverless instances are fully-managed, autoscaled, and automatically upgraded by Elastic so you can
focus more on gaining value and insight from your data.

Elastic provides three serverless solutions available on {ecloud}:

* **{es-serverless}**: Build powerful applications and search experiences using a rich ecosystem of vector search capabilities, APIs, and libraries.
* **{observability}**: Monitor your own platforms and services using powerful machine learning and analytics tools with your logs, metrics, traces, and APM data.
* **{elastic-sec}**: Detect, investigate, and respond to threats, with SIEM, endpoint protection, and AI-powered analytics capabilities.

Serverless instances of the Elastic Stack that you create in {ecloud} are called **serverless projects**.
