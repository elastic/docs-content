The built-in <DocLink slug="/serverless/general/assign-user-roles" section="organization-level-roles">organization-level roles</DocLink> and <DocLink slug="/serverless/general/assign-user-roles" section="instance-access-roles">instance access roles</DocLink> are great for getting started with ((serverless-full)), and for system administrators who do not need more restrictive access.

As an administrator, however, you have the ability to create your own roles to describe exactly the kind of access your users should have within a specific project.
For example, you might create a marketing_user role, which you then assign to all users in your marketing department.
This role would grant access to all of the necessary data and features for this team to be successful, without granting them access they don't require.
{/* Derived from https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/tutorial-secure-access-to-kibana.html */}

All custom roles grant the same access as the `Viewer` instance access role with regards to ((ecloud)) privileges.
To grant more ((ecloud)) privileges, assign more roles.
Users receive a union of all their roles' privileges.

You can manage custom roles in **((project-settings)) → ((manage-app)) →((custom-roles-app))**.
To create a new custom role, click the **Create role** button.
To clone, delete, or edit a role, open the actions menu:

Roles are a collection of privileges that enable users to access project features and data.
For example, when you create a custom role, you can assign ((es)) cluster and index privileges and ((kib)) privileges.

## ((es)) cluster privileges

Cluster privileges grant access to monitoring and management features in ((es)).
They also enable some ((stack-manage-app)) capabilities in your project.

![Create a custom role and define ((es)) cluster privileges](../images/custom-roles-cluster-privileges.png)
{/* TO-DO: This screenshot needs to be refreshed and automated. */}

Refer to [cluster privileges](((ref))/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-cluster) for a complete description of available options.

## ((es)) index privileges

Each role can grant access to multiple data indices, and each index can have a different set of privileges.
Typically, you will grant the `read` and `view_index_metadata` privileges to each index that you expect your users to work with.
For example, grant access to indices that match an `acme-marketing-*` pattern:

![Create a custom role and define ((es)) index privileges](../images/custom-roles-index-privileges.png)
{/* TO-DO: This screenshot needs to be refreshed and automated. */}

Refer to [index privileges](((ref))/security-privileges.html#privileges-list-indices) for a complete description of available options.

Document-level and field-level security affords you even more granularity when it comes to granting access to your data.
With document-level security (DLS), you can write an ((es)) query to describe which documents this role grants access to.
With field-level security (FLS), you can instruct ((es)) to grant or deny access to specific fields within each document.
{/* Derived from https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/kibana-role-management.html#adding_cluster_privileges */}

## ((kib)) privileges

When you create a custom role, click **Add Kibana privilege** to grant access to specific features.
The features that are available vary depending on the project type.
For example, in ((es-serverless)):

![Create a custom role and define ((kib)) privileges](../images/custom-roles-kibana-privileges.png)
{/* TO-DO: This screenshot needs to be refreshed and automated. */}

Open the **Spaces** selection control to specify whether to grant the role access to all spaces or one or more individual spaces.
When using the **Customize by feature** option, you can choose either **All**, **Read** or **None** for access to each feature.

All
: Grants full read-write access.

Read
: Grants read-only access.

None
: Does not grant any access.

Some features have finer access control and you can optionally enable sub-feature privileges.

<DocCallOut title="New features">
As new features are added to ((serverless-full)), roles that use the custom option do not automatically get access to the new features. You must manually update the roles.
</DocCallOut>

After your roles are set up, the next step to securing access is to assign roles to your users.
Click the **Assign roles** link to go to the **Members** tab of the **Organization** page.
