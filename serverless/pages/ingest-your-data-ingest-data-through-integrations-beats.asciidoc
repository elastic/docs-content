{beats} are lightweight data shippers that send operational data to {es}.
Elastic provides separate {beats} for different types of data, such as logs, metrics, and uptime.
Depending on what data you want to collect, you may need to install multiple shippers on a single host.

{beats} can send data to {es} directly or through {ls}, where you
can further process and enhance the data before visualizing it in {kib}.

.Authenticating with {es}
[NOTE]
====
When you use {beats} to export data to an {es-serverless} project, the {beats} require an API key to authenticate with {es}.
Refer to <<elasticsearch-get-started-create-api-key,Create API key>> for the steps to set up your API key,
and to https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/beats-api-keys.html[Grant access using API keys] in the Filebeat documentation for an example of how to configure your {beats} to use the key.
