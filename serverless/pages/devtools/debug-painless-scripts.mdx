The **Painless Lab** is an interactive code editor that lets you test and debug [Painless scripts](((ref))/modules-scripting-painless.html) in real-time.
You can use Painless to safely write inline and stored scripts anywhere scripts are supported.

To get started, open the main menu, click **Developer Tools**, and then click **Painless Lab**.
