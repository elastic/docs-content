((es)) has a powerful [Profile API](((ref))/search-profile.html) for debugging search queries.
It provides detailed timing information about the execution of individual components in a search request.
This allows users to optimize queries for better performance.

However, Profile API responses can be hard to read, especially for complex queries.
**((searchprofiler))** helps you visualize these responses in a graphical interface.

<div id="search-profiler-getting-started"></div>

## Get started

Access **((searchprofiler))** under **Dev Tools**.

**((searchprofiler))** displays the names of the indices searched and how long it took for the query to complete.
Test it out by replacing the default `match_all` query with the query you want to profile, and then select **Profile**.

The following example shows the results of profiling the `match_all` query.
If you take a closer look at the information for the `.security_7` sample index, the
**Cumulative time** field shows you that the query took 0.028ms to execute.

![((searchprofiler)) `match_all` example](../images/profiler-overview.png)

{/* <DocCallOut title="Note">

The cumulative time metric is the sum of individual shard times.
It is not necessarily the actual time it took for the query to return (wall clock time).
Because shards might be processed in parallel on multiple nodes, the wall clock time can
be significantly less than the cumulative time.
However, if shards are colocated on the same node and executed serially, the wall clock time is closer to the cumulative time.

While the cumulative time metric is useful for comparing the performance of your
indices and shards, it doesn't necessarily represent the actual physical query times.

</DocCallOut> */}
{/* Commenting out for moment, given shards and nodes are obfuscated concepts in serverless */}

To see more profiling information, select **View details**.
You'll find details about query components and the timing
breakdown of low-level methods.
For more information, refer to [Profiling queries](((ref))/search-profile.html#profiling-queries) in the ((es)) documentation.

## Filter for an index or type

By default, all queries executed by the **((searchprofiler))** are sent
to `GET /_search`.
It searches across your entire cluster (all indices, all types).

To query a specific index or type, you can use the **Index** filter.

In the following example, the query is executed against the indices `.security-7` and `kibana_sample_data_ecommerce`.
This is equivalent to making a request to `GET /.security-7,kibana_sample_data_ecommerce/_search`.

## Profile a more complicated query

To understand how the query trees are displayed inside the **((searchprofiler))**,
take a look at a more complicated query.

1. Index the following data using **Console**:

    ```js
    POST test/_bulk
    {"index":{}}
    {"name":"aaron","age":23,"hair":"brown"}
    {"index":{}}
    {"name":"sue","age":19,"hair":"red"}
    {"index":{}}
    {"name":"sally","age":19,"hair":"blonde"}
    {"index":{}}
    {"name":"george","age":19,"hair":"blonde"}
    {"index":{}}
    {"name":"fred","age":69,"hair":"blonde"}
    ```
    {/* CONSOLE */}

1. From the **((searchprofiler))**, enter **test** in the **Index** field to restrict profiled
    queries to the `test` index.

1. Replace the default `match_all` query in the query editor with a query that has two sub-query
    components and includes a simple aggregation:
    ```js
    {
       "query": {
          "bool": {
             "should": [
                {
                   "match": {
                      "name": "fred"
                   }
                },
                {
                   "terms": {
                      "name": [
                          "sue",
                          "sally"
                      ]
                   }
                }
             ]
          }
       },
       "aggs": {
          "stats": {
             "stats": {
                "field": "price"
             }
          }
       }
    }
    ```
    {/* NOTCONSOLE */}

1. Select **Profile** to profile the query and visualize the results.

    ![Profiling the more complicated query](../images/profiler-gs8.png)

    - The top `BooleanQuery` component corresponds to the `bool` in the query.
    - The second `BooleanQuery` corresponds to the `terms` query, which is internally
    converted to a `Boolean` of `should` clauses. It has two child queries that correspond
    to "sally" and "sue from the `terms` query.
    - The `TermQuery` that's labeled with "name:fred" corresponds to `match: fred` in the query.


    In the time columns, the **Self time** and **Total time** are no longer
    identical on all rows:

    - **Self time** represents how long the query component took to execute.
    - **Total time** is the time a query component and all its children took to execute.

    Therefore, queries like the Boolean queries often have a larger total time than self time.

1. Select **Aggregation Profile** to view aggregation profiling statistics.

    This query includes a `stats` agg on the `"age"` field.
    The **Aggregation Profile** tab is only enabled when the query being profiled contains an aggregation.

1. Select **View details** to view the timing breakdown.

    For more information about how the **((searchprofiler))** works, how timings are calculated, and
    how to interpret various results, refer to
    [Profiling queries](((ref))/search-profile.html#profiling-queries) in the ((es)) documentation.

## Render pre-captured profiler JSON

Sometimes you might want to investigate performance problems that are temporal in nature.
For example, a query might only be slow at certain time of day when many customers are using your system.
You can set up a process to automatically profile slow queries when they occur and then
save those profile responses for later analysis.

The **((searchprofiler))** supports this workflow by allowing you to paste the
pre-captured JSON in the query editor.
The **((searchprofiler))** will detect that you
have entered a JSON response (rather than a query) and will render just the visualization,
rather than querying the cluster.

To see how this works, copy and paste the following profile response into the
query editor and select **Profile**.

   "took": 3,
   "timed_out": false,
