((agent)) is a single, unified way to add monitoring for logs, metrics, and other types of data to a host.
It can also protect hosts from security threats, query data from operating systems, forward data from remote services or hardware, and more.
A single agent makes it easier and faster to deploy monitoring across your infrastructure.
Each agent has a single policy you can update to add integrations for new data sources, security protections, and more.

((fleet)) provides a web-based UI to centrally manage your ((agents)) and their policies.

To learn more, refer to the [Fleet and Elastic Agent documentation](((fleet-guide))).
