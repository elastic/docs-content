A _search_ consists of one or more queries that are combined and sent to {es}.
Documents that match a search's queries are returned in the _hits_, or
_search results_, of the response.

A search may also contain additional information used to better process its
queries. For example, a search may be limited to a specific index or only return
a specific number of results.

You can use the https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch-serverless/group/endpoint-search[search API] to search and
aggregate data stored in {es} data streams or indices.
The API's `query` request body parameter accepts queries written in
{ref}/query-dsl.html[Query DSL].

For more information, refer to {ref}/search-your-data.html[the search API overview] in the classic {es} docs.
