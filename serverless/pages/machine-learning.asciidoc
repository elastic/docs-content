To view your {ml} resources, go to **{project-settings} → {manage-app} → {ml-app}**:

// TO-DO: This screenshot should be automated.

The {ml-features} that are available vary by project type:

* {es-serverless} projects have trained models.
* {observability} projects have {anomaly-jobs}.
* {elastic-sec} projects have {anomaly-jobs}, {dfanalytics-jobs}, and trained models.

For more information, go to {ml-docs}/ml-ad-overview.html[{anomaly-detect-cap}], {ml-docs}/ml-dfanalytics.html[{dfanalytics-cap}] and {ml-docs}/ml-nlp.html[Natural language processing].

[[machine-learning-synchronize-saved-objects]]
== Synchronize saved objects

Before you can view your {ml} {dfeeds}, jobs, and trained models in {kib}, they must have saved objects.
For example, if you used APIs to create your jobs, wait for automatic synchronization or go to the **{ml-app}** page and click **Synchronize saved objects**.

[[machine-learning-export-and-import-jobs]]
== Export and import jobs

You can export and import your {ml} job and {dfeed} configuration details on the **{ml-app}** page.
For example, you can export jobs from your test environment and import them in your production environment.

The exported file contains configuration details; it does not contain the {ml} models.
For {anomaly-detect}, you must import and run the job to build a model that is accurate for the new environment.
For {dfanalytics}, trained models are portable; you can import the job then transfer the model to the new cluster.
Refer to {ml-docs}/ml-trained-models.html#export-import[Exporting and importing {dfanalytics} trained models].

There are some additional actions that you must take before you can successfully import and run your jobs:

* The {data-sources} that are used by {anomaly-detect} {dfeeds} and {dfanalytics} source indices must exist; otherwise, the import fails.
* If your {anomaly-jobs} use custom rules with filter lists, the filter lists must exist; otherwise, the import fails.
* If your {anomaly-jobs} were associated with calendars, you must create the calendar in the new environment and add your imported jobs to the calendar.
