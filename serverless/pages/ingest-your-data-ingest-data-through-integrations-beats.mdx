<DocBadge template="technical preview" />
((beats)) are lightweight data shippers that send operational data to ((es)).
Elastic provides separate ((beats)) for different types of data, such as logs, metrics, and uptime.
Depending on what data you want to collect, you may need to install multiple shippers on a single host.

| Data | ((beats))|
|---|---|
| Audit data | [Auditbeat](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/auditbeat) |
| Log files and journals | [Filebeat](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/filebeat)|
| Cloud data | [Functionbeat](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/functionbeat)|
| Availability | [Heartbeat](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/heartbeat)|
| Metrics | [Metricbeat](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/metricbeat)|
| Network traffic | [Packetbeat](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/packetbeat)|
| Windows event logs | [Winlogbeat](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/winlogbeat)|

((beats)) can send data to ((es)) directly or through ((ls)), where you
can further process and enhance the data before visualizing it in ((kib)).


<DocCallOut title="Authenticating with Elasticsearch">
When you use ((beats)) to export data to an ((es)) project, the ((beats)) require an API key to authenticate with ((es)).
Refer to <DocLink slug="/serverless/elasticsearch/get-started" section="create-api-key" text="Create API key"/> for the steps to set up your API key,
and to [Grant access using API keys](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/beats-api-keys.html) in the Filebeat documentation for an example of how to configure your ((beats)) to use the key.
