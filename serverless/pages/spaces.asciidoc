// :description: Organize your project and objects into multiple spaces.

This content applies to: {es-badge} {obs-badge} {sec-badge}

Spaces enable you to organize your dashboards and other saved
objects into meaningful categories. Once inside a space, you see only
the dashboards and saved objects that belong to that space.

When you create and enter a new project, you're using the default space of that project.

You can identify the space you're in or switch to a different space from the header.
