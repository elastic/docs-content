If you know your current password:

1. Navigate to the **Password** section and select **Change password**.

1. Enter the current password and provide the new password that you want to use.

## Enable multi-factor authentication

To add an extra layer of security, you can either set up Google authenticator or text messaging on a mobile device.

<DocCallOut title="Tip">
Before you start using multi-factor authentication, verify that your device has SMS capabilities or download the Google Authenticator application onto your device.
</DocCallOut>

To enable multi-factor authentication, you must enroll your device.

1. Navigate to the **Multi-factor authentication** section.

1. Select **Configure** to enable the Authenticator app or **Add a phone number** to enable the Text message.

If the device you want to remove is your only enrolled device, you must disable multi-factor authentication first. If your device is lost or stolen, contact [support](https://support.elastic.co/).
