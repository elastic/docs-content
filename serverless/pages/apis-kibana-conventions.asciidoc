= Management API conventions

// :description: The Management APIs for {serverless-short} have request header conventions.
// :keywords: serverless, kibana, API, reference

The Management REST APIs for {serverless-full} let you manage resources that are available in multiple solutions.
These resources include connectors, data views, and saved objects.
If you've previously used the {stack}, the Management APIs are similar to {kib} APIs.

Management API calls are stateless.
Each request that you make happens in isolation from other calls and must include all of the necessary information for {kib} to fulfill the request.
API requests return JSON output, which is a format that is machine-readable and works well for automation.

To interact with Management APIs, use the following operations:

* GET: Fetches the information.
* POST: Adds new information.
* PUT: Updates the existing information.
* DELETE: Removes the information.

You can prepend any Management API endpoint with `kbn:` and run the request in **{dev-tools-app} â†’ Console**.
For example:

[source,shell]
----
GET kbn:/api/data_views
----

[[elasticsearch-kibana-api-conventions-request-headers]]
== Request headers

When you call Management APIs outside of the Console, you must provide a request header.
The Management APIs support the `Authorization`, `Content-Type`, and  `kbn-xsrf` headers.

`Authorization: ApiKey`::

Management APIs use key-based authentication.
You must create an API key and use the encoded value in the request header.
To learn about creating keys, go to <<api-keys>>.

`Content-Type: application/json`::

You must use this header when you send a payload in the API request.
Typically, if you include the `kbn-xsrf` header, you must also include the `Content-Type` header.

`kbn-xsrf: true`::

You must use this header for all API calls except `GET` or `HEAD` operations.

/*
TBD: Are these settings accessible to users in serverless projects?

This header is also not required when:
* The path is allowed using the `server.xsrf.allowlist` setting
* XSRF protections are disabled using the `server.xsrf.disableProtection` setting
*/
////

For example:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST \
  "${KIBANA_URL}/api/data_views/data_view" \
  -H "Authorization: ApiKey ${API_KEY}" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'kbn-xsrf: true' \
  -d '{
    "data_view": {
      "title": "books*",
      "name": "My Books Data View"
      }
    }
'
