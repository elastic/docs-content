In **{project-settings} → {manage-app} → {ls-pipelines-app}**, you can control multiple {ls} instances and pipeline configurations.

On the {ls} side, you must enable configuration management and register {ls} to use the centrally managed pipeline configurations.

[IMPORTANT]
====
After you configure {ls} to use centralized pipeline management, you can no longer specify local pipeline configurations.
The `pipelines.yml` file and settings such as `path.config` and `config.string` are inactive when centralized pipeline management is enabled.

/*
TBD: What is the appropriate RBAC for serverless?
If {kib} is protected with basic authentication, make sure your {kib} user has
the `logstash_admin` role as well as the `logstash_writer` role that you created
when you configured Logstash to use basic authentication. Additionally,
in order to view (as read-only) non-centrally-managed pipelines in the pipeline management
UI, make sure your {kib} user has the `monitoring_user` role as well.

. To add a new pipeline, go to **{project-settings} → {manage-app} → {ls-pipelines-app}** and click **Create pipeline**. Provide the following details, then click **Create and deploy**.

Pipeline ID::
A name that uniquely identifies the pipeline.
This is the ID that you used when you configured centralized pipeline management and specified a list of pipeline IDs in the `xpack.management.pipeline.id` setting.

Description::
A description of the pipeline configuration. This information is for your use.

Pipeline::
The pipeline configuration.
You can treat the editor like any other editor.
You don't have to worry about whitespace or indentation.

Pipeline workers::
The number of parallel workers used to run the filter and output stages of the pipeline.

Pipeline batch size::
The maximum number of events an individual worker thread collects before
executing filters and outputs.

Pipeline batch delay::
Time in milliseconds to wait for each event before sending an undersized
batch to pipeline workers.

Queue type::
The internal queueing model for event buffering.
Options are `memory` for in-memory queueing and `persisted` for disk-based acknowledged queueing.

Queue max bytes::
The total capacity of the queue when persistent queues are enabled.

Queue checkpoint writes::
The maximum number of events written before a checkpoint is forced when
persistent queues are enabled.

To delete one or more pipelines, select their checkboxes then click **Delete**.
