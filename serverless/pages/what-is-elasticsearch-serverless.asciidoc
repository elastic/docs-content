[TIP]
====
If you haven't used {es} before, you might want to learn the basics in the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/elasticsearch-intro.html[main {es} documentation].
====

{es} is an open source distributed search and analytics engine, scalable data store, and vector database. It’s optimized for speed and relevance on production-scale workloads. Use {es} to search, index, store, and analyze data of all shapes and sizes.

{es} is one of the three available project types on <<intro,{serverless-full}>>.

When using {es} on {serverless-full} you don’t need to worry about managing the infrastructure that keeps {es} distributed and available: nodes, shards, and replicas. These resources are 100% automated on the serverless platform, which is designed to scale up and down with your workload.

This allows you to focus on building your search applications and solutions, without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
