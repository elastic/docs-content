// :keywords: serverless, elasticsearch, overview

Elasticsearch allows you to build custom applications. Whether you have structured or unstructured text, numerical data, or geospatial data, Elasticsearch can efficiently store and index it in a way that supports fast searches.

.Understanding Elasticsearch on serverless
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you haven't used {es} before, first learn the basics in the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/elasticsearch-intro.html[core {es} documentation].
====

{es} is one of the three available project types on <<intro,{serverless-full}>>.

This project type enables you to use the core functionality of {es}: searching, indexing, storing, and analyzing data of all shapes and sizes.

When using {es} on {serverless-full} you don’t need to worry about managing the infrastructure that keeps {es} distributed and available: nodes, shards, and replicas. These resources are completely automated on the serverless platform, which is designed to scale up and down with your workload.

This automation allows you to focus on building your search applications and solutions.
