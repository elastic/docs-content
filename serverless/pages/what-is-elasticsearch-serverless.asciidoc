[TIP]
====
If you haven't used Elasticsearch before, you might want to learn the basics in the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/elasticsearch-intro.html[main Elasticsearch documentation].
====

Elasticsearch is an open source distributed search and analytics engine, scalable data store, and vector database. It’s optimized for speed and relevance on production-scale workloads. Use Elasticsearch to search, index, store, and analyze data of all shapes and sizes.

Elasticsearch is one of the three available project types on <<intro,Elastic Cloud Serverless>>.

When using Elasticsearch on Elastic Cloud Serverless you don’t need to worry about managing the infrastructure that keeps Elasticsearch distributed and available: nodes, shards, and replicas. These resources are 100% automated on the serverless platform, which is designed to scale up and down with your workload.

This allows you to focus on building your search applications and solutions, without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
