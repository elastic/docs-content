To view your ((ml)) resources, go to **((project-settings)) → ((manage-app)) → ((ml-app))**:

!["Anomaly detection job management"](../images/ml-security-management.png)
{/* TO-DO: This screenshot should be automated. */}

The ((ml-features)) that are available vary by project type:

- ((es-serverless)) projects have trained models.
- ((observability)) projects have ((anomaly-jobs)).
- ((security)) projects have ((anomaly-jobs)), ((dfanalytics-jobs)), and trained models.

For more information, go to [((anomaly-detect-cap))](((ml-docs))/ml-ad-overview.html), [((dfanalytics-cap))](((ml-docs))/ml-dfanalytics.html) and [Natural language processing](((ml-docs))/ml-nlp.html).

## Synchronize saved objects

Before you can view your ((ml)) ((dfeeds)), jobs, and trained models in ((kib)), they must have saved objects.
For example, if you used APIs to create your jobs, wait for automatic synchronization or go to the **((ml-app))** page and click **Synchronize saved objects**.

## Export and import jobs

You can export and import your ((ml)) job and ((dfeed)) configuration details on the **((ml-app))** page.
For example, you can export jobs from your test environment and import them in your production environment.

The exported file contains configuration details; it does not contain the ((ml)) models.
For ((anomaly-detect)), you must import and run the job to build a model that is accurate for the new environment.
For ((dfanalytics)), trained models are portable; you can import the job then transfer the model to the new cluster.
Refer to [Exporting and importing ((dfanalytics)) trained models](((ml-docs))/ml-trained-models.html#export-import).

There are some additional actions that you must take before you can successfully import and run your jobs:

- The ((data-sources)) that are used by ((anomaly-detect)) ((dfeeds)) and ((dfanalytics)) source indices must exist; otherwise, the import fails.
- If your ((anomaly-jobs)) use custom rules with filter lists, the filter lists must exist; otherwise, the import fails.
- If your ((anomaly-jobs)) were associated with calendars, you must create the calendar in the new environment and add your imported jobs to the calendar.
