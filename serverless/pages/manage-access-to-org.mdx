To allow other users to interact with your projects, you must invite them to join your organization.

When inviting them, you also <DocLink slug="/serverless/general/assign-user-roles" text="assign roles"/> to define their access to your organization resources and instances.

1. Go to the user icon on the header bar and select **Organization**.

2. Click **Invite members**.

   You can add multiple members by entering their email addresses separated by a space.

   You can grant access to all projects of the same type with a unique role, or select individual roles for specific projects only.

   <DocCallOut color="success">
      In **Instance access**, The **Deployment** tab correspond to [hosted deployments](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-getting-started.html), while **Elasticsearch**, **Observability**, and **Security** correspond to serverless projects.
   </DocCallOut>

3. Click **Send invites**.

   Invitations to join an organization are sent by email. Invited users have 72 hours to accept the invitation. If they do not join within that period, you will have to send a new invitation.

On the **Members** tab of the **Organization** page, you can view the list of current members, their status and role.

In the **Actions** column, click the three dots to edit a memberâ€™s role or revoke the invite.

## Leave an organization

On the **Organization** page, click **Leave organization**.

If you're the only user in the organization, you can only leave if you have deleted all your projects and don't have any pending bills.
