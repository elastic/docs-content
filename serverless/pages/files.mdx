Several ((serverless-full)) features let you upload files. For example, you can add files to <DocLink slug="/serverless/observability/cases" text="cases" /> or upload a logo to an **Image** panel in a <DocLink slug="/serverless/elasticsearch/explore-your-data-dashboards" text="dashboard" />.

You can access these uploaded files in **((project-settings)) → ((manage-app)) → ((files-app))**.
