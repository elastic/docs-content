<DocBadge template="technical preview" />
This page guides you through the installation process of the
PHP client for ((es3)), shows you how to initialize the client, and how to perform basic
((es)) operations with it.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.0 or higher installed on your system.

## Installation

### Using the command line

You can install the PHP client using
[composer](https://getcomposer.org/) with the following commands:

```bash
composer require elastic/elasticsearch-serverless
```

## Initialize the client

Initialize the client using your API key and Elasticsearch Endpoint:

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Elastic\Elasticsearch\Serverless\ClientBuilder;

$client = ClientBuilder::create()
  ->setEndpoint('<elasticsearch-endpoint>')
  ->setApiKey('<api-key>')
  ->build();
```

To get API keys or the Elasticsearch Endpoint for a project, see <DocLink slug="/serverless/elasticsearch/get-started" />.

## Using the API

After you've initialized the client, you can start ingesting documents. You can
use the `bulk` API for this. This API enables you to index, update, and delete
several documents in one request.

### Creating an index and ingesting documents

You can call the `bulk` API with a body parameter, an array of actions (index)
and documents.

The following is an example of indexing some classic books into the `books`
index:

```php
$body = [
    [ "index" => [ "_index" => "books" ]],
    [ "name" => "Snow Crash", "author" => "Neal Stephenson", "release_date" => "1992-06-01", "page_count" => 470],
    [ "index" => [ "_index" => "books" ]],
    [ "name" => "Revelation Space", "author" => "Alastair Reynolds", "release_date" => "2000-03-15", "page_count" => 585],
    [ "index" => [ "_index" => "books" ]],
    [ "name" => "1984", "author" => "George Orwell", "release_date" => "1949-06-08", "page_count" => 328],
    [ "index" => [ "_index" => "books" ]],
    [ "name" => "Fahrenheit 451", "author" => "Ray Bradbury", "release_date" => "1953-10-15", "page_count" => 227],
    [ "index" => [ "_index" => "books" ]],
    [ "name" => "Brave New World", "author" => "Aldous Huxley", "release_date" => "1932-06-01", "page_count" => 268],
    [ "index" => [ "_index" => "books" ]],
    [ "name" => "The Handmaid's Tale", "author" => "Margaret Atwood", "release_date" => "1985-06-01", "page_count" => 311]
];

$response = $client->bulk(body: $body);
# You can check the response if the items are indexed and have an ID
print_r($response['items']);
```

When you use the client to make a request to ((es)), it returns an API response
object. This object implements the [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/)
interface, that means you can check the for the HTTP status using the following
method:

```php
print($response->getStatusCode());
```

or get the HTTP response headers using the following:

```php
print_r($response->getHeaders());
```

or reading the HTTP response body as follows:

```php
print($response->getBody()->getContents());
# or using the asString() dedicated method
print($response->asString());
```

The response body can be accessed as associative array or as object.

```php
var_dump($response['items']); # associative array
var_dump($response->items);   # object
```

There are also methods to render the response as array, object, string and
boolean values.

```php
var_dump($response->asArray());  // response body content as array
var_dump($response->asObject()); // response body content as object
var_dump($response->asString()); // response body as string (JSON)
var_dump($response->asBool());   // true if HTTP response code between 200 and 300
```

### Getting documents

You can get documents by using the following code:

```php
$response = $client->get(index: "books", id: $id);
```

### Searching

You can search your documents using the `search` API:

```php
# Search for all the books written by Ray Bradbury
$query = [ 'query' => [ 'match' => [ 'author' => 'Ray Bradbury' ]]];
$response = $client->search(index: "books", body: $query);

printf("Documents found: %d\n", $response['hits']['total']['value']); # total documents found
print_r($response['hits']['hits']); # list of books
```

For more information about the `search` API's query parameters and the response type,
refer to the
[Search API](/api-reference/search/search-2)
docs.

### Updating documents

You can call the `update` API to update a document:

```php
$id = '<insert the document ID>';
# update the "page_count" value to 300
$body = [ "doc" => [ "page_count" => 300 ]];
$response = $client->update(index: "books", id: $id, body: $body);
printf("Operation result: %s\n", $response['result']); # You get 'updated' as a result.
```

### Deleting documents

You can call the `delete` API to delete a document:

```php
$id = '<insert the document ID>';
$response = $client->delete(index: "books", id: $id);
printf("Operation result: %s\n", $response['result']); # You get "deleted" a as result.
```

### Deleting an index

You can delete an entire index as follows:

```php
$response = $client->indices()->delete(index: "books");
if ($response['acknowledged']) {
    print("Index successfully removed!");
}
```
