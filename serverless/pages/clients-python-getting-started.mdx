<DocBadge template="technical preview" />
This page guides you through the installation process of the Python
client for ((es3)), shows you how to initialize the client, and how to perform basic
((es)) operations with it.

## Requirements

* Python 3.7 or higher
* [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

## Documentation

Find the full documentation for the Python client on [readthedocs](https://elasticsearch-serverless-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

## Installation

### Using the command line

You can install the Python client with the following
commands:

```bash
python -m pip install elasticsearch-serverless
```


## Initialize the client

Initialize the client using your API key and Elasticsearch Endpoint:

```python
from elasticsearch_serverless import Elasticsearch

client = Elasticsearch(
    "https://...",  # Your project's Elasticsearch Endpoint
    api_key='api-key',  # API key for your project
)
```

To get API keys or the Elasticsearch Endpoint for a project, see <DocLink slug="/serverless/elasticsearch/get-started" />.


## Using the API

After you've initialized the client, you can start ingesting documents. You can use
the `bulk` API for this. This API enables you to index, update, and delete several
documents in one request.


### Creating an index and ingesting documents

You can call the `bulk` API with a body parameter, an array of hashes that
define the action, and a document.

The following is an example of indexing some classic books into the `books`
index:

```python
from datetime import datetime

client.bulk(
    body=[
        {"index": {"_index": "books", "_id": "1"}},
        {"title": "Infinite Jest", "author": "David Foster Wallace", "published_on": datetime(1996, 2, 1)},
        {"index": {"_index": "books", "_id": "2"}},
        {"title": "Ulysses", "author": "James Joyce", "published_on": datetime(1922, 2, 2)},
        {"index": {"_index": "books", "_id": "3"}},
        {"title": "Just Kids", "author": "Patti Smith", "published_on": datetime(2010, 1, 19)},
    ],
)
```


### Getting documents

You can get documents by using the following code:

```python
response = client.get(index="books", id="1")
print(response.body)
```

### Searching

Now that some data is available, you can search your documents using the
`search` API:

```python
response = client.search(index="books", query={
    "match": {
        "title": "infinite"
    }
})

for hit in response["hits"]["hits"]:
    print(hit["_source"])
```

### Updating a document

You can call the `update` API to update a document:

```python
client.update(index="books", id="2", doc={
    "author": "James Augustine Aloysius Joyce",
    "pages": 732,
})
```

### Deleting a document

You can call the `delete` API to delete a document:

```python
client.delete(index="books", id="3")
```


### Deleting an index


```python
client.indices.delete(index="books")
```
