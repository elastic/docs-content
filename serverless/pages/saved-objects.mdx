TBD: Need serverless-specific RBAC requirements
## Required permissions

To access **Saved Objects**, you must have the required `Saved Objects Management` ((kib)) privilege.

To add the privilege, open the main menu, and then click **Stack Management → Roles**.

<DocCallOut title="Note">
Granting access to `Saved Objects Management` authorizes users to
manage all saved objects in ((kib)), including objects that are managed by
applications they may not otherwise be authorized to access.
</DocCallOut> */}

## View and delete

* To view and edit a saved object in its associated application, click the object title.

* To show objects that use this object, so you know the impact of deleting it, click the actions icon <DocIcon type="boxesHorizontal" title="More actions" /> and then select **Relationships**.

* To delete one or more objects, select their checkboxes, and then click **Delete**.

## Import and export

Use import and export to move objects between different ((kib)) instances.
These actions are useful when you have multiple environments for development and production.
Import and export also work well when you have a large number of objects to update and want to batch the process.

{/*
TBD: Do these APIs exist for serverless?
((kib)) also provides <DocLink id="enKibanaSavedObjectsApiImport">import</DocLink> and
<DocLink id="enKibanaSavedObjectsApiExport">export</DocLink> APIs to automate this process.
*/}

### Import

Import multiple objects in a single operation.

1. In the toolbar, click **Import**.
1. Select the NDJSON file that includes the objects you want to import.

1. Select the import options. By default, saved objects already in ((kib)) are overwritten.

1. Click **Import**.

{/*
TBD: Are these settings configurable in serverless?
<DocCallOut title="Note">
The <DocLink id="enKibanaSettings" section="savedObjects-maxImportExportSize">`savedObjects.maxImportExportSize`</DocLink> configuration setting
limits the number of saved objects to include in the file. The
<DocLink id="enKibanaSettings" section="savedObjects-maxImportPayloadBytes">`savedObjects.maxImportPayloadBytes`</DocLink> setting limits the overall
size of the file that you can import.
</DocCallOut>
*/}

### Export

Export objects by selection or type.

* To export specific objects, select them in the table, and then click **Export**.
* To export objects by type, click **Export objects** in the toolbar.

((kib)) creates an NDJSON with all your saved objects.
By default, the NDJSON includes child objects related to the saved objects.
Exported dashboards include their associated ((data-sources)).

The <DocLink id="enKibanaSettings" section="savedObjects-maxImportExportSize">`savedObjects.maxImportExportSize`</DocLink> configuration setting limits the number of saved objects that you can export.
