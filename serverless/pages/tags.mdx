TBD: What are the serverless RBAC requirements?
## Required permissions

To create tags, you must meet the minimum requirements.

* Access to **Tags** requires the `Tag Management` Kibana privilege. To add the privilege, open the main menu,
    and then click **Management → Custom Roles**.

* The `read` privilege allows you to assign tags to the saved objects for which you have write permission.
* The `write` privilege enables you to create, edit, and delete tags.

<DocCallOut title="Note">
Having the `Tag Management` ((kib)) privilege is not required to
view tags assigned on objects you have `read` access to, or to filter objects by tags
from the global search.
</DocCallOut>
