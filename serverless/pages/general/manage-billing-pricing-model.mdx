## Add-ons

### Data out

_Data out_ accounts for all of the traffic coming out of a serverless project.
This includes search results, as well as monitoring data sent from the project.
The same rate applies regardless of the destination of the data, whether to the internet,
another region, or a cloud provider account in the same region.
Data coming out of the project through AWS PrivateLink, GCP Private Service Connect,
or Azure Private Link is also considered data out.
