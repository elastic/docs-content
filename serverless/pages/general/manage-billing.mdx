<DocCallOut color="warning" title="Serverless billing starts June 1, 2024">
    Until May 31, 2024, your serverless consumption will not incur any charges, but will be visible along with your total Elastic Cloud consumption on the [Billing Usage page](https://cloud.elastic.co/billing/usage?). Unless you are in a trial period, usage on or after June 1, 2024 will be deducted from your existing Elastic Cloud credits or be billed to your active payment method.
</DocCallOut>

You can manage the billing details of your organization directly from the Elastic Cloud console.

1. Navigate to [cloud.elastic.co](https://cloud.elastic.co/) and log in to your Elastic Cloud account.

2. Go to the user icon on the header bar and select **Billing**.

From the **Billing pages**, you can perform the following tasks:

- <DocLink slug="/serverless/general/check-subscription" text="Check your subscription overview"/>
- <DocLink slug="/serverless/general/monitor-usage" text="Monitor and analyze your account usage"/>
- <DocLink slug="/serverless/general/billing-history" text="Check your billing history"/>

If you have a project that you're no longer using, refer to <DocLink slug="/serverless/general/billing-stop-project" text="Stop charges for a project"/>.
