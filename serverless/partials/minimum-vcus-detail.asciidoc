.Minimum runtime VCUs
[IMPORTANT]
====
When you create an Elasticsearch Serverless project, a minimum number of VCUs are always allocated to your project to maintain basic capabilities. These VCUs are used for the following purposes:

* **Ingest**: Ensure constant availability for ingesting data into your project (4 VCUs).
* **Search**: Maintain a data cache and support low latency searches (8 VCUs).

These minimum VCUs are billed at the standard rate per VCU hour, incurring a minimum cost even when you're not actively using your project.
