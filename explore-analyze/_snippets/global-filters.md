You can interact with filter pills to edit them, temporarily alter their behavior without having to delete them, or make them available in other contexts. The following options are available when selecting a filter pill:

**Pin across all apps** and **Unpin**
:    Adds this filter to available dashboards and to apps such as **Discover**, **Lens**, **Maps**, and **Visualize**. The filter is removed if you:
     * Unpin it. In this case, the filter only remains on the currently open app, unpinned.
     * Remove it from any place while it's still pinned.

     :::{tip}
     When a pinned filter can't be applied, for example if a field specified in the filter doesn't exist in the current data view, the filter is ignored and shows in a different color.
     :::

**Edit filter**
:    Lets you edit and update the filter.

**Exclude results** and **Include results**
:    Reverses the filter behavior.

**Temporarily disable** and **Re-enable**
:    Lets you temporarily disable a filter instead of requiring you to delete it. This is particularly useful for testing different filter combinations.

**Delete**
:    Deletes the filter.

You can perform most of these actions at once for all filters in your current view using the **Filter** icon {icon}`filter`. From the menu that opens, select **Apply to all**, then choose the action you'd like to perform.
