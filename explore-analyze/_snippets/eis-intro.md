The Elastic {{infer-cap}} Service (EIS) enables you to leverage AI-powered search as a service without deploying a model in your environment.
With EIS, you don't need to manage the infrastructure and resources required for {{ml}} {{infer}} by adding, configuring, and scaling {{ml}} nodes.
Instead, you can use {{ml}} models for ingest, search, and chat independently of your {{es}} infrastructure.
