# AIOps Labs

% What needs to be done: Align serverless/stateful

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/kibana/kibana/xpack-ml-aiops.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/observability-machine-learning.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$change-point-detection$$$

$$$log-pattern-analysis$$$

$$$log-rate-analysis$$$
