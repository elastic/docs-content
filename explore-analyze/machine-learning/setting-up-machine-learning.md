# Setting up machine learning [setup]

## Requirements overview [requirements-overview]

To use the {{stack}} {ml-features}, you must have:

* the [appropriate subscription](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions) level or the free trial period activated
* `xpack.ml.enabled` set to its default value of `true` on every node in the cluster (refer to [{{ml-cap}} settings in {{es}}](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ml-settings.html))
* `ml` value defined in the list of `node.roles` on the [{{ml}} nodes](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-node.html#ml-node)
* {{ml}} features visible in the {{kib}} space
* security privileges assigned to the user that:

  * grant use of {{ml-features}}, and
  * grant access to source and destination indices.

::::{tip}
The fastest way to get started with {{ml-features}} is to [start a free 14-day trial of {{ess}}](https://cloud.elastic.co/registration?page=docs&placement=docs-body) in the cloud.

## Security privileges [setup-privileges]

Assigning security privileges affects how users access {{ml-features}}. Consider the two main categories:

* **[{{es}} API user](#es-security-privileges)**: uses an {{es}} client, cURL, or {{kib}} Dev Tools to access {{ml-features}} via {{es}} APIs. It requires {{es}} security privileges.
* **[{{kib}} user](#kib-security-privileges)**: uses the {{ml-features}} in {{kib}} and does not use Dev Tools. It requires either {{kib}} feature privileges or {{es}} security privileges and is granted the most permissive combination of both. {{kib}} feature privileges are recommended if you control job level visibility via **Spaces**. {{ml-cap}} features must be visible in the relevant space. Refer to [Feature visibility in Spaces](#kib-visibility-spaces) for configuration information.

You can configure these privileges

* under **Security**. To open Security, find **{{stack-manage-app}}** in the main menu or use the [global search field](../find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).
* via the respective {{es}} security APIs.

### {{es}} API user [es-security-privileges]

If you use {{ml}} APIs, you must have the following cluster and index privileges:

For full access:

* `machine_learning_admin` built-in role or the equivalent cluster privileges
* `read` and `view_index_metadata` on source indices
* `read`, `manage`, and `index` on destination indices (for {{dfanalytics-jobs}} only)

For read-only access:

* `machine_learning_user` built-in role or the equivalent cluster privileges
* `read` index privileges on source indices
* `read` index privileges on destination indices (for {{dfanalytics-jobs}} only)

::::{important}
The `machine_learning_admin` and `machine_learning_user` built-in roles give access to the results of *all* {{anomaly-jobs}}, irrespective of whether the user has access to the source indices. You must carefully consider who is given these roles, as {{anomaly-job}} results may propagate field values that contain sensitive information from the source indices to the results.
::::

### {{kib}} security [kib-security]

::::{important}
Granting `All` or `Read` {{kib}} feature privilege for {{ml-app}} will also grant the role the equivalent feature privileges to certain types of {{kib}} saved objects, namely index patterns, dashboards, saved searches, and visualizations as well as {{ml}} job, trained model and module saved objects.
::::

#### Feature visibility in Spaces [kib-visibility-spaces]

In {{kib}}, the {{ml-features}} must be visible in your [space](../../deploy-manage/manage-spaces.md#spaces-control-feature-visibility). To manage which features are visible in your space, go to **{{stack-manage-app}}** > **{{kib}}** > **Spaces** or use the [global search field](../find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md) to locate **Spaces** directly.

:::

In addition to index privileges, source {{data-sources}} must also exist in the same space as your {{ml}} jobs. You can configure these under **{{data-sources-caps}}**. To open **{{data-sources-caps}}**, find **{{stack-manage-app}}** > **{{kib}}** in the main menu, or use the [global search field](../find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).

Each {{ml}} job and trained model can be assigned to all, one, or multiple spaces. This can be configured in **Machine Learning**. To open **Machine Learning**, find **{{stack-manage-app}} > Alerts and Insights** in the main menu, or use the [global search field](../find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md). You can edit the spaces that a job or model is assigned to by clicking the icons in the **Spaces** column.

#### {{kib}} user [kib-security-privileges]

Within a {{kib}} space, for full access to the {{ml-features}}, you must have:

* `Machine Learning: All` {{kib}} privileges
* `Data Views Management: All` {{kib}} feature privileges
* `read`, and `view_index_metadata` index privileges on your source indices
* {{data-sources}} for your source indices
* {{data-sources}}, `read`, `manage`, and `index` index privileges on destination indices (for {{dfanalytics-jobs}} only)

Within a {{kib}} space, for read-only access to the {{ml-features}}, you must have:

* `Machine Learning: Read` {{kib}} privileges
* {{data-sources}} for your source indices
* `read` index privilege on your source indices
* {{data-sources}} and `read` index privileges on destination indices (for {{dfanalytics-jobs}} only)

::::{important}
A user who has full or read-only access to {{ml-features}} within a given {{kib}} space can view the results of *all* {{anomaly-jobs}} that are visible in that space, even if they do not have access to the source indices of those jobs. You must carefully consider who is given access to {{ml-features}}, as {{anomaly-job}} results may propagate field values that contain sensitive information from the source indices to the results.
::::

::::{note}
{{data-sources-cap}} can be automatically created when creating a {{dfanalytics-job}}.
::::

For access to use {{ml}} APIs via *Dev Tools* in {{kib}}, set the {{es}} security privileges and grant access to `machine_learning_admin` or `machine_learning_user` built-in roles.

#### {{data-viz}} feature [upload-file-security-privileges]

Within a {{kib}} space, to upload and import files in the **{{data-viz}}**, you must have:

* `Machine Learning: Read` or `Discover: All` {{kib}} feature privileges
* `Data Views Management: All` {{kib}} feature privileges
* `ingest_admin` built-in role, or `manage_ingest_pipelines` cluster privilege
* `create`, `create_index`, `manage` and `read` index privileges for destination indices

For more information, see [Security privileges](../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/elasticsearch-privileges.md) and [{{kib}} privileges](../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/kibana-privileges.md).
