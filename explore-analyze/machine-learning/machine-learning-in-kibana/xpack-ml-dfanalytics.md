# Data frame analytics [xpack-ml-dfanalytics]

The Elastic {{ml}} {{dfanalytics}} feature enables you to analyze your data using {{classification}}, {{oldetection}}, and {{regression}} algorithms and generate new indices that contain the results alongside your source data.

If you have a license that includes the {{ml-features}}, you can create {{dfanalytics}} jobs and view their results on the **Data Frame Analytics** page in {{kib}}. For example:

:::{image} ../../../images/kibana-classification.png
:alt: {{classification-cap}} results in {kib}
:class: screenshot
:::

For more information about the {{dfanalytics}} feature, see [{{ml-cap}} {{dfanalytics}}](../data-frame-analytics.md).
