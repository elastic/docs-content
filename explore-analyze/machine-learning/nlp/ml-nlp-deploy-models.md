# Deploy trained models [ml-nlp-deploy-models]

If you want to perform {{nlp}} tasks in your cluster, you must deploy an appropriate trained model. There is tooling support in [Eland](https://github.com/elastic/eland) and {{kib}} to help you prepare and manage models.

1. [Select a trained model](ml-nlp-select-model.md).
2. [Import the trained model and vocabulary](ml-nlp-import-model.md).
3. [Deploy the model in your cluster](ml-nlp-deploy-model.md).
4. [Try it out](ml-nlp-test-inference.md).
