# Anomaly detection

% What needs to be done: Align serverless/stateful

% Scope notes: Colleen McGinnis removed "https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/serverless/current/observability-machine-learning.html" and "All children" because this page is also used below in "AIOps Labs" with "All children" selected. We can't copy all children to two places.
