# Files [files]

The Files management page provides a centralized view of all files uploaded to {{product.kibana}}, including images added to dashboards, attachments in cases, and other uploaded assets. From this page, you can view file metadata, download files, or remove them to manage storage.

Files uploaded through different {{product.kibana}} features appear here regardless of where they were originally added, making it easier to audit file usage and maintain your {{product.kibana}} instance.
