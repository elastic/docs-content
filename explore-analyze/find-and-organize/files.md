# Files [files]

This content applies to: [![Elasticsearch](../../images/serverless-es-badge.svg "")](../../solutions/search.md) [![Observability](../../images/serverless-obs-badge.svg "")](../../solutions/observability.md) [![Security](../../images/serverless-sec-badge.svg "")](../../solutions/security/elastic-security-serverless.md)

Several {{serverless-full}} features let you upload files. For example, you can add files to [cases](../../solutions/observability/incident-management/cases.md) or upload a logo to an **Image** panel in a [Dashboard](../dashboards.md).

You can access these uploaded files in **{{project-settings}} → {{manage-app}} → {{files-app}}**.
