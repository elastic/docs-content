# Saved objects

% What needs to be done: Refine

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/saved-objects.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/kibana/kibana/managing-saved-objects.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/kibana/kibana/saved-object-ids.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$managing-saved-objects-copy-to-space$$$

$$$managing-saved-objects-export-objects$$$

$$$managing-saved-objects-share-to-space$$$
