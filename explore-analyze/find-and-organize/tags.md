# Tags [managing-tags]


Use tags to categorize your saved objects, then filter for related objects based on shared tags.

To get started, go to the **Tags** management page using the navigation menu or the [global search field](../../explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).

## Permissions [_required_permissions_10]

To create tags, you must meet the minimum requirements.

* Access to **Tags** requires a role with the the `Tag Management` Kibana privilege.
* The `read` privilege allows to assign tags to the saved objects for which you have write permission.
* The `write` privilege allows to create, edit, and delete tags.

::::{note}
Having the `Tag Management` {{kib}} privilege is not required to view tags assigned on objects you have `read` access to, or to filter objects by tags from the global search.
