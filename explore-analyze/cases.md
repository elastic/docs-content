# Cases [cases]

Cases are a collaboration and tracking tool, which is particularly useful for incidents or issues that arise from alerts. You can group related alerts into a case for easier management, add notes and comments to provide context, track investigation progress, and assign cases to team members or link them to external systems. Cases ensure that teams have a central place to track and resolve alerts efficiently.

## Get started [cases-get-started]

Ready to start using cases? First, make sure users have the [required permissions](cases/configure-case-access.md). Then [create your first case](cases/create-cases.md).

To streamline your workflow, you can also [configure case settings](cases/manage-cases-settings.md) to add external connectors, custom fields, and templates.
