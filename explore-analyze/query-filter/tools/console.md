# Console

% What needs to be done: Refine

% Scope notes: Add mentions of query tools (search profiler...)

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/kibana/kibana/console-kibana.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud-enterprise/ece-api-console.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$configuring-console$$$

$$$import-export-console-requests$$$
