# Search profiler [xpack-profiler]

{{es}} has a powerful [Profile API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-profile.html) that you can use to inspect and analyze your search queries. The response returns a large JSON blob, which can be difficult to analyze manually.

The **{{searchprofiler}}** tool can transform this JSON output into a visualization that is easy to navigate, allowing you to diagnose and debug poorly performing queries much faster.


## Get started [search-profiler-getting-started]

Find the **{{searchprofiler}}** by navigating to the **Developer tools** page using the navigation menu or the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).

**{{searchprofiler}}** displays the names of the indices searched, the shards in each index, and how long it took for the query to complete. To try it out, replace the default `match_all` query with the query you want to profile, and then click **Profile**.

The following example shows the results of profiling the `match_all` query. If you take a closer look at the information for the `.security_7` sample index, the **Cumulative time** field shows you that the query took 0.028ms to execute.

::::{note}
The cumulative time metric is the sum of individual shard times. It is not necessarily the actual time it took for the query to return (wall clock time). Because shards might be processed in parallel on multiple nodes, the wall clock time can be significantly less than the cumulative time. However, if shards are colocated on the same node and executed serially, the wall clock time is closer to the cumulative time.

While the cumulative time metric is useful for comparing the performance of your indices and shards, it doesn’t necessarily represent the actual physical query times.

To see more profiling information, click **View details**. You’ll see details about the query components that ran on the shard and the timing breakdown of low-level methods. For more information, refer to [Profiling queries](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-profile.html#profiling-queries).


## Filter for an index or type [_filter_for_an_index_or_type]

By default, all queries executed by the **{{searchprofiler}}** are sent to `GET /_search`. It searches across your entire cluster (all indices, all types).

To query a specific index or type, you can use the **Index** filter.

In the following example, the query is executed against the indices `.security-7` and `kibana_sample_data_ecommerce`. This is equivalent making a request to `GET /test,kibana_1/_search`.

## Profile a more complicated query [profile-complicated-query]

To understand how the query trees are displayed inside the **{{searchprofiler}}**, take a look at a more complicated query.

1. Index the following data via **Console**:

    ```console
    POST test/_bulk
    {"index":{}}
    {"name":"aaron","age":23,"hair":"brown"}
    {"index":{}}
    {"name":"sue","age":19,"hair":"red"}
    {"index":{}}
    {"name":"sally","age":19,"hair":"blonde"}
    {"index":{}}
    {"name":"george","age":19,"hair":"blonde"}
    {"index":{}}
    {"name":"fred","age":69,"hair":"blonde"}
    ```

2. From the **{{searchprofiler}}**, enter **test** in the **Index** field to restrict profiled queries to the `test` index.
3. Replace the default `match_all` query in the query editor with a query that has two sub-query components and includes a simple aggregation:

    ```js
    {
       "query": {
          "bool": {
             "should": [
                {
                   "match": {
                      "name": "fred"
                   }
                },
                {
                   "terms": {
                      "name": [
                          "sue",
                          "sally"
                      ]
                   }
                }
             ]
          }
       },
       "aggs": {
          "stats": {
             "stats": {
                "field": "price"
             }
          }
       }
    }
    ```

4. Click **Profile** to profile the query and visualize the results.

    :::{image} ../../../images/kibana-gs8.png
    :alt: Profiling the more complicated query
    :class: screenshot
    :::

    * The top `BooleanQuery` component corresponds to the bool in the query.
    * The second `BooleanQuery` corresponds to the terms query, which is internally converted to a `Boolean` of should clauses. It has two child queries that correspond to "sally" and "sue from the terms query.
    * The `TermQuery` that’s labeled with "name:fred" corresponds to match: fred in the query.

        If you look at the time columns, you can see that **Self time** and **Total time** are no longer identical on all the rows.  **Self time** represents how long the query component took to execute. **Total time** is the time a query component and all its children took to execute. Therefore, queries like the Boolean queries often have a larger total time than self time.

5. Click **Aggregation Profile** to view aggregation profiling statistics.

    This query includes a `stats` agg on the `"age"` field. The **Aggregation Profile** tab is only enabled when the query being profiled contains an aggregation.

6. Click **View details** to view the timing breakdown.

## Render pre-captured profiler JSON [profiler-render-JSON]

The **{{searchprofiler}}** queries the cluster that the {{kib}} node is attached to. It does this by executing the query against the cluster and collecting the results.

Sometimes you might want to investigate performance problems that are temporal in nature. For example, a query might only be slow at certain time of day when many customers are using your system. You can set up a process to automatically profile slow queries when they occur and then save those profile responses for later analysis.

The **{{searchprofiler}}** supports this workflow by allowing you to paste the pre-captured JSON in the query editor.  The **{{searchprofiler}}** will detect that you have entered a JSON response (rather than a query) and will render just the visualization, rather than querying the cluster.

To see how this works, copy and paste the following profile response into the query editor and click **Profile**.

```js
