# QueryDSL

% What needs to be done: Refine

% Scope notes: everything but language reference. Add links to reference's new location. Merge those 2 pages together

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/query-dsl.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/query-filter-context.md
%      Notes: maybe

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$filter-context$$$

$$$query-dsl-allow-expensive-queries$$$

$$$relevance-scores$$$
