# ES|QL [esql]

% What needs to be done: Refine

% Scope notes: everything but language reference. Merge the pages about Kibana. Add links to reference's new location

## What's {{esql}}? [_the_esql_compute_engine]

**Elasticsearch Query Language ({{esql}})** is a piped query language for filtering, transforming, and analyzing data. 

You can author {{esql}} queries to find specific events, perform statistical analysis, and generate visualizations. It supports a wide range of [commands, functions and operators](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/esql-functions-operators.html) to perform various data operations, such as filtering, aggregation, time-series analysis, and more. Today, it supports a subset of the features available in Query DSL, but it is rapidly evolving.

::::{note}
**{{esql}}'s compute architecture**

{{esql}} is built on top of a new compute architecture within {{es}}, designed to achieve high functional and performance requirements for {{esql}}. {{esql}} search, aggregation, and transformation functions are directly executed within Elasticsearch itself. Query expressions are not transpiled to Query DSL for execution. This approach allows {{esql}} to be extremely performant and versatile.

The new {{esql}} execution engine was designed with performance in mind â€” it operates on blocks at a time instead of per row, targets vectorization and cache locality, and embraces specialization and multi-threading. It is a separate component from the existing Elasticsearch aggregation framework with different performance characteristics.

## How does it work? [search-analyze-data-esql]

The {{es}} Query Language ({{esql}}) makes use of "pipes" (|) to manipulate and transform data in a step-by-step fashion. This approach allows you to compose a series of operations, where the output of one operation becomes the input for the next, enabling complex data transformations and analysis.

You can use it:
- In your queries to {{es}} APIs, using the [`_query` endpoint](/explore-analyze/query-filter/languages/esql-rest.md) that accepts queries written in {{esql}} syntax.
- Within various {{kib}} tools such as Discover and Dashboards, to explore your data and build powerful visualizations.
