# Rule types [rule-types]

A rule is a set of [conditions](../alerts.md#alerting-concepts-conditions), [schedules](../alerts.md#alerting-concepts-scheduling), and [actions](../alerts.md#alerting-concepts-actions) that enable notifications. {{kib}} provides rules built into the {{stack}} and rules registered by one of the {{kib}} apps. You can create most rules types in [{{stack-manage-app}} > {{rules-ui}}](create-manage-rules.md). Security rules must be defined in the Security app. For more information, refer to the documentation about [creating a detection rule](../../../solutions/security/detect-and-alert/create-detection-rule.md).

::::{note} 
Some rule types are subscription features, while others are free features. For a comparison of the Elastic subscription levels, see [the subscription page](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions).

## Stack rules [stack-rules] 

[Stack rules](create-manage-rules.md) are built into {{kib}}. To access the **Stack Rules** feature and create and edit rules, users require the `all` privilege. See [feature privileges](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/kibana-privileges.md#kibana-feature-privileges) for more information.

| --- | --- |
| [{{es}} query](rule-type-es-query.md) | Run a user-configured {{es}} query, compare the number of matches to a configured threshold, and schedule actions to run when the threshold condition is met. |
| [Index threshold](rule-type-index-threshold.md) | Aggregate field values from documents using {{es}} queries, compare them to threshold values, and schedule actions to run when the thresholds are met. |
| [{{transform-cap}} rules](../../transforms/transform-alerts.md) | [beta] Run scheduled checks on a {{ctransform}} to check its health. If a {{ctransform}} meets the conditions, an alert is created and the associated action is triggered. |
| [Tracking containment](geo-alerting.md) | Run an {{es}} query to determine if any documents are currently contained in any boundaries from a specified boundary index and generate alerts when a rule’s conditions are met. |


## {{observability}} rules [observability-rules] 

{{observability}} rules detect complex conditions in your observability data and create alerts when a rule’s conditions are met. For example, you can create a rule that detects when the value of a metric exceeds a specified threshold or when an anomaly occurs on a system or service you are monitoring. For more information, refer to [Alerting](../../../solutions/observability/incident-management/alerting.md).

::::{note} 
If you create a rule in the {{observability}} app, its alerts are not visible in **{{stack-manage-app}} > {{rules-ui}}**. They are visible only in the {{observability}} app.

## Machine learning rules [ml-rules] 

[beta] [{{ml-cap}} rules](../../machine-learning/anomaly-detection/ml-configuring-alerts.md) run scheduled checks on an {{anomaly-job}} to detect anomalies with certain conditions. If an anomaly meets the conditions, an alert is created and the associated action is triggered.


## Security rules [security-rules] 

Security rules detect suspicious source events with pre-built or custom rules and create alerts when a rule’s conditions are met. For more information, refer to [Security rules](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/prebuilt-rules.html).

::::{note} 
Alerts associated with security rules are visible only in the {{security-app}}; they are not visible in **{{stack-manage-app}} > {{rules-ui}}**.
