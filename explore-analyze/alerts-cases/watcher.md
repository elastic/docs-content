% What needs to be done: Lift-and-shift

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/xpack-alerting.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud/ec-watcher.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/kibana/kibana/watcher-ui.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/elasticsearch-differences.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/kibana/kibana/secure-reporting.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$watcher-create-advanced-watch$$$

$$$ec-cloud-email-service-limits$$$

$$$ec-watcher-custom-mail-server$$$

$$$watcher-create-threshold-alert$$$

$$$watcher-deactivate$$$
