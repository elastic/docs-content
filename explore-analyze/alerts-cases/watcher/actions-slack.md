# Slack action [actions-slack]


Use the `slack` action to send messages to a [Slack](https://slack.com/) team’s channels or users. To send Slack messages, you need to [configure at least one Slack account](#configuring-slack) in `elasticsearch.yml`.

## Configuring Slack actions [configuring-slack-actions]

You configure Slack actions in the `actions` array. Action-specific attributes are specified using the `slack` keyword.

The following snippet shows a simple slack action definition:

```js
"actions" : {
  "notify-slack" : {
    "transform" : { ... },
    "throttle_period" : "5m",
    "slack" : {
      "message" : {
        "to" : [ "#admins", "@chief-admin" ], <1>
        "text" : "Encountered  {{ctx.payload.hits.total}} errors in the last 5 minutes (facepalm)" <2>
      }
    }
  }
}
```

1. The channels and users you want to send the message to.
2. The content of the message.



## Using attachments to format Slack messages [formatting-slack-messages]

In addition to sending simple text-based messages, you can use the Slack [attachment](https://api.slack.com/docs/attachments) mechanism to send formatted messages. {{watcher}} leverages Slack attachments to enable you to dynamically populate templated messages from the execution context payload.

The following snippet shows a standard message attachment:

```js
"actions" : {
  "notify-slack" : {
    "throttle_period" : "5m",
    "slack" : {
      "account" : "team1",
      "message" : {
        "from" : "watcher",
        "to" : [ "#admins", "@chief-admin" ],
        "text" : "System X Monitoring",
        "attachments" : [
          {
            "title" : "Errors Found",
            "text" : "Encountered  {{ctx.payload.hits.total}} errors in the last 5 minutes (facepalm)",
            "color" : "danger"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

$$$slack-dynamic-attachment$$$
To define an attachment template that is dynamically populated from the payload, you specify `dynamic_attachments` in the watch action. For example, a dynamic attachment could reference histogram buckets in the payload and build an attachment per bucket.

In the following example, the watch input executes a search with a date histogram aggregation and the Slack action:

1. Transforms the payload to a list where each item in the list holds the month, the user count for that month, and the color that represents the sentiment associated with that count (danger or bad).
2. Defines an attachment template that references items in the list generated by the transform.

```js
"input" : {
  "search" : {
    "request" : {
      "body" : {
        "aggs" : {
          "users_per_month" : {
            "date_histogram" : {
              "field" : "@timestamp",
              "interval" : "month"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
},
...
"actions" : {
  "notify-slack" : {
    "throttle_period" : "5m",
    "transform" : {
      "script" : {
        "source" : "['items': ctx.payload.aggregations.users_per_month.buckets.collect(bucket -> ['count': bucket.doc_count, 'name': bucket.key_as_string, 'color': bucket.doc_count < 100 ? 'danger' : 'good'])]",
        "lang" : "painless"
      }
    },
    "slack" : {
      "account" : "team1",
      "message" : {
        "from" : "watcher",
        "to" : [ "#admins", "@chief-admin" ],
        "text" : "System X Monitoring",
        "dynamic_attachments" : {
          "list_path" : "ctx.payload.items" <1>
          "attachment_template" : {
            "title" : "{{month}}", <2>
            "text" : "Users Count: {{count}}",
            "color" : "{{color}}"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

1. The list generated by the action’s transform.
2. The parameter placeholders refer to attributes in each item of the list generated by the transform.

## Configuring Slack Accounts [configuring-slack]

You configure the accounts {{watcher}} can use to communicate with Slack in the `xpack.notification.slack` namespace in `elasticsearch.yml`.

You need a Slack App with the [Incoming Webhooks feature](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) to configure a Slack account. Use the generated webhook URL to set up your Slack account in {{es}}.

To configure a Slack account, at a minimum you need to specify the account name and webhook URL in the {{es}} keystore (see [secure settings](../../../deploy-manage/security/secure-settings.md)):

```shell
bin/elasticsearch-keystore add xpack.notification.slack.account.monitoring.secure_url
```

::::{warning}
You can no longer configure Slack accounts using `elasticsearch.yml` settings. Please use {{es}}'s secure [keystore](../../../deploy-manage/security/secure-settings.md) method instead.

::::


You can specify defaults for the [Slack notification attributes](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/notification-settings.html#slack-account-attributes):

```yaml
xpack.notification.slack:
  account:
    monitoring:
      message_defaults:
        from: x-pack
        to: notifications
        icon: http://example.com/images/watcher-icon.jpg
        attachment:
          fallback: "X-Pack Notification"
          color: "#36a64f"
          title: "X-Pack Notification"
          title_link: "https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/x-pack/current/index.html"
          text: "One of your watches generated this notification."
          mrkdwn_in: "pretext, text"
```

To notify multiple channels, create a webhook URL for each channel in Slack and multiple Slack accounts in {{es}} (one for each webhook URL).

If you configure multiple Slack accounts, you either need to configure a default account or specify which account the notification should be sent with in the [`slack`]() action.

```yaml
xpack.notification.slack:
  default_account: team1
  account:
    team1:
      ...
    team2:
      ...
```
