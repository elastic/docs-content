# Find and organize content


$$$saved-objects-copy-to-other-spaces$$$

When using Elastic, you create, manage, and export various types of content, called objects. From data views that let your organize your {{es}} data into logical subsets, to dashboards and reports that let you visualize and share insights with others. 

This section describes what those objects are, how you can organize them, and how you can find them quickly when navigating the user interface.
