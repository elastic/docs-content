# Find and organize content

% What needs to be done: Refine

% Scope notes: could be rebranded as "saving and labeling" / "organize content"  consider references to spaces + saved queries here?

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/saved-objects.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/project-settings-content.md

When using Elastic, you create, manage, and export various types of content, called objects. From data views that let your organize your {{es}} data into logical subsets, to dashboards and reports that let you visualize and share insights with others. 

This section describes what those objects are, how you can organize them, and how you can find them quickly when navigating the user interface.
