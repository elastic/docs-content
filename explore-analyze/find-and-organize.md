# Find and organize content

% What needs to be done: Refine

% Scope notes: could be rebranded as "saving and labeling" / "organize content"  consider references to spaces + saved queries here?

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/saved-objects.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/project-settings-content.md
