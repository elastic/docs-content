Custom Icons

You can also use your own SVG icon to style Point features in your map. In **Layer settings** open the **icon** dropdown, and click the **Add custom icon** button. For best results, your SVG icon should be monochrome and have limited details.

Dynamic styling in **Elastic Maps** requires rendering SVG icons as PNGs using a [signed distance function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_distance_function). As a result, sharp corners and intricate details may not render correctly. Modifying the settings under **Advanced Options** in the **Add custom icon** modal may improve rendering.

Manage your custom icons in [settings](maps-settings.md).

| **Border width** | The border width of the polygon features. |
| **Fill color** | The fill color of the polygon features. |
| **Label** | Specifies label content. For polygons, the label is positioned at the polygon centroid. For multi-polygons, the label is positioned at the largest polygon centroid. |
| **Label visibility** | Specifies the zoom range for which labels are displayed. |
| **Label color** | The text color. |
| **Label size** | The size of the text, in pixels. |
| **Label border color** | The color of the label border. |
