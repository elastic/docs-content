# Troubleshoot [maps-troubleshooting]


Use the information in this section to inspect Elasticsearch requests and find solutions to common problems.


## Inspect Elasticsearch requests [_inspect_elasticsearch_requests]

Maps uses the [{{es}} vector tile search API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-search-mvt) and the [{{es}} search API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-search) to get documents and aggregation results from {{es}}. Use **Vector tiles** inspector to view {{es}} vector tile search API requests. Use **Requests** inspector to view {{es}} search API requests.

## Solutions to common problems [_solutions_to_common_problems]


### Data view not listed when adding layer [_data_view_not_listed_when_adding_layer]

* Verify your geospatial data is correctly mapped as [geo_point](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/geo-point.html) or [geo_shape](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/geo-shape.html).

    * Run `GET myIndexName/_field_caps?fields=myGeoFieldName` in [Console](../../query-filter/tools/console.md), replacing `myIndexName` and `myGeoFieldName` with your index and geospatial field name.
    * Ensure response specifies `type` as `geo_point` or `geo_shape`.

* Verify your geospatial data is correctly mapped in your [data view](../../find-and-organize/data-views.md#managing-fields).

    * Open your data view in [Stack Management](../../../deploy-manage/index.md).
    * Ensure your geospatial field type is `geo_point` or `geo_shape`.
    * Ensure your geospatial field is searchable and aggregatable.
    * If your geospatial field type does not match your Elasticsearch mapping, click the **Refresh** button to refresh the field list from Elasticsearch.

* Data views with thousands of fields can exceed the default maximum payload size. Increase [`server.maxPayload`](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure.md) for large data views.


### Features are not displayed [_features_are_not_displayed]

* Use Inspector to view {{es}} responses. Ensure the response is not empty.
* Ensure geometry uses the correct latitude and longitude ordering.

    * Geo-points expressed as strings are ordered as `"latitude,longitude"`. Geo-points expressed as arrays are ordered as the reverse: `[longitude, latitude]`.
    * Geo-shapes expressed as geojson provide coordinates as `[longitude, latitude]`.

* Ensure fill color and border color are distinguishable from map tiles. Itâ€™s hard to see white features on a white background.


### Elastic Maps Service basemaps are not displayed [_elastic_maps_service_basemaps_are_not_displayed]

**Maps** uses tile and vector data from Elastic Maps Service by default. See [Connect to Elastic Maps Service](maps-connect-to-ems.md) for more info.


### Custom tiles are not displayed [_custom_tiles_are_not_displayed]

* When using a custom tile service, ensure your tile server has configured [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) so tile requests from your {{kib}} domain have permission to access your tile server domain.
* Ensure custom vector and tile services have the required coordinate system. Vector data must use EPSG:4326 and tiles must use EPSG:3857.
