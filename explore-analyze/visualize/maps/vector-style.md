# Vector styling [vector-style]

When styling a vector layer, you can customize your data by property, such as size and color. For each property, you can specify whether to use a constant or data driven value for the style.


## Static styling [maps-vector-style-static]

Use static styling to specify a constant value for a style property.

This image shows an example of static styling using the [Kibana sample web logs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/get-started.html) data set. The **kibana_sample_data_logs** layer uses static styling for all properties.

## Data driven styling [maps-vector-style-data-driven]

Use data driven styling to symbolize features by property values. To enable data driven styling for a style property, change the selected value from **Fixed** or **Solid** to **By value**.

This image shows an example of data driven styling using the [Kibana sample web logs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/get-started.html) data set. The **kibana_sample_data_logs** layer uses data driven styling for fill color and symbol size style properties.

* The `hour_of_day` property determines the fill color for each feature based on where the value fits on a linear scale. Light green circles symbolize documents that occur earlier in the day, and dark green circles symbolize documents that occur later in the day.
* The `bytes` property determines the size of each symbol based on where the value fits on a linear scale. Smaller circles symbolize documents with smaller payloads, and larger circles symbolize documents with larger payloads.

## Quantitative data driven styling [maps-vector-style-quantitative-data-driven]

Quantitative data driven styling symbolizes features from a range of numeric property values.

Property values are fit from the domain range to the style range on a linear scale. For example, letâ€™s symbolize [Kibana sample web log](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/get-started.html) documents by size. The sample web logs `bytes` field ranges from 0 to 18,000. This is the domain range. The smallest feature has a symbol radius of 1, and the largest feature has a symbol radius of 24. This is the style range. The `bytes` property value for each feature will fit on a linear scale from the range of 0 to 18,000 to the style range of 1 to 24.

For color styles, values are fit from the domain range to the color ramp with one of the following:

* **Interpolate (default)**. Interpolate values between min and max to a color band on a linear scale. The color ramp is divided into eight bands.
* **Percentiles**. Use percentiles to divide the color ramp into bands that map to values.
* **Custom**. Define custom color ramp bands and ranges.

When the property value is undefined for a feature:

* **Fill color** and **Border color** are set to transparent and are not visible.
* **Border width** and **Symbol size** are set to the minimum size.
* **Symbol orientation** is set to 0.

When the symbol range minimum and maximum are the same and there is no range:

* **Fill color** and **Border color** are set to last color in the color ramp.
* **Border width** and **Symbol size** are set to the maximum size.


## Qualitative data driven styling [maps-vector-style-qualitative-data-driven]

Qualitative data driven styling symbolizes properties, such as strings and IP addresses, by category.

Qualitative data driven styling is available for the following styling properties:

* **Icon**
* **Fill color**
* **Border color**
* **Label color**
* **Label border color**

This image shows an example of quantitative data driven styling using the [Kibana sample web logs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/get-started.html) data set. The `machine.os.keyword` property determines the color of each symbol based on category.

## Class styling [maps-vector-style-class]

Class styling symbolizes features by class and requires multiple layers. Use [layer filtering](maps-layer-based-filtering.md) to define the class for each layer, and [static styling](#maps-vector-style-static) to symbolize each class.

This image shows an example of class styling using the [Kibana sample web logs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/get-started.html) data set.

* The **Mac OS requests** layer applies the filter `machine.os : osx` so the layer only contains Mac OS requests. The fill color is a static value of green.
* The **Window OS requests** layer applies the filter `machine.os : win*` so the layer only contains Window OS requests. The fill color is a static value of red.
