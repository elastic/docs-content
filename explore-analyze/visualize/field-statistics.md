# Field statistics [field-statistics-dashboard]

**Field statistics** panels allow you to display a table with additional field information in your dashboards, such as document count, values, and distribution.

1. From your dashboard, select **Add panel**.
2. Choose **Field statistics** under **Visualizations**. An ES|QL editor appears and lets you configure your query with the fields and information that you want to show.

   ::::{tip}
   Check the [ES|QL reference](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/esql-language.html) to get familiar with the syntax and optimize your query.

3. When editing your query or its configuration, run the query to update the preview of the visualization.
