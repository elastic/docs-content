## Metrics aggregations [metrics-aggregations] 

Metric aggregations are calculated from the values in the aggregated documents. The values are extracted from the document fields.

## Bucket aggregations [bucket-aggregations] 

Bucket aggregations group, or bucket, documents based on the aggregation type. To define the document buckets, bucket aggregations compute and return the number of documents for each bucket.

| Aggregation | **Lens** | **TSVB** | **Aggregation-based** | **Vega** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Histogram | &check; |  | &check; | &check; |
| Date histogram | &check; | &check; | &check; | &check; |
| Date range | Use filters | &check; | &check; | &check; |
| Filter |  | &check; |  | &check; |
| Filters | &check; | &check; | &check; | &check; |
| GeoHash grid |  |  | &check; | &check; |
| IP prefix | Use filters | Use filters | &check; | &check; |
| IP range | Use filters | Use filters | &check; | &check; |
| Range | &check; | Use filters | &check; | &check; |
| Terms | &check; | &check; | &check; | &check; |
| Significant terms | &check; |  | &check; | &check; |

## Pipeline aggregations [pipeline-aggregations] 

Pipeline aggregations are dependent on the outputs calculated from other aggregations. Parent pipeline aggregations are provided with the output of the parent aggregation, and compute new buckets or aggregations that are added to existing buckets. Sibling pipeline aggregations are provided with the output of a sibling aggregation, and compute new aggregations for the same level as the sibling aggregation.

| Aggregation | **Lens** | **TSVB** | **Aggregation-based** | **Vega** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avg bucket | [`overall_average` formula](lens.md#lens-formulas) | &check; | &check; | &check; |
| Derivative | &check; | &check; | &check; | &check; |
| Max bucket | [`overall_max` formula](lens.md#lens-formulas) | &check; | &check; | &check; |
| Min bucket | [`overall_min` formula](lens.md#lens-formulas) | &check; | &check; | &check; |
| Sum bucket | [`overall_sum` formula](lens.md#lens-formulas) | &check; | &check; | &check; |
| Moving average | &check; | &check; | &check; | &check; |
| Cumulative sum | &check; | &check; | &check; | &check; |
| Bucket script |  | &check; | &check; | &check; |
| Bucket selector |  |  |  | &check; |
| Serial differencing |  | &check; | &check; | &check; |
