# Visualize Library [visualize-library]

The **Visualize Library** is a space where you can save visualization panels that you may want to use across multiple dashboards. The **Visualize Library** consists of two pages:

* **Visualizations**
* **Annotation groups**


## Visualizations [visualize-library-visualizations]

By default the **Visualizations** page opens first. Here you can create new visualizations, or select from a list of previously created visualizations. To learn more, refer to [save to the Visualize Library](../../explore-analyze/visualize/manage-panels.md).


## Annotation groups [visualize-library-annotation-groups]

**Annotation groups** give you the option to mark points on a visualization panel with events, such as a deployment, to help track performance. These annotations can be reused across multiple visualization panels.
