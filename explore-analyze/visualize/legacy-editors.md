# Legacy editors [legacy-editors]

Legacy editors are still available but have been replaced by better alternatives. Consider using one of the [modern editors](../visualize.md) offered in Elastic such as **Lens**.

The legacy editors are:

- [Aggregation-based](legacy-editors/aggregation-based.md)
- [TSVB](legacy-editors/tsvb.md)
- [Timelion](legacy-editors/timelion.md)
