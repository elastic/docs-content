# Legacy visualization editors [legacy-editors]

Legacy visualization editors including aggregation-based, TSVB, and Timelion remain available for existing visualizations but are no longer recommended for new work. Lens provides equivalent or superior functionality with a more intuitive interface.

:::{note}
Legacy panel types only appear in the **Add panel** dashboard menu if you already have such panels in your dashboards. If you have never used these panel types, use Lens instead.
:::

The legacy editors are:

- [Aggregation-based](legacy-editors/aggregation-based.md)
- [TSVB](legacy-editors/tsvb.md)
- [Timelion](legacy-editors/timelion.md)
