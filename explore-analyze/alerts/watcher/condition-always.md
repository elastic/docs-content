# Always condition [condition-always]


Use the `always` condition to perform the watch actions whenever the watch is triggered, unless they are [throttled](actions.md#actions-ack-throttle).

The `always` condition enables you to perform watch actions on a fixed schedule, such as, *"Every Friday at noon, send a status report email to `sys.admin@example.com`"*

## Using the always condition [_using_the_always_condition]

This is the default if you omit the condition definition from a watch.

There are no attributes to specify for the `always` condition. To explicitly use this condition, specify the condition type and associate it with an empty object:

```js
"condition" : {
  "always" : {}
}
```
