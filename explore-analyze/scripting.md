# Scripting [modules-scripting]

With scripting, you can evaluate custom expressions in {{es}}. For example, you can use a script to return a computed value as a field or evaluate a custom score for a query.

The default scripting language is [Painless](scripting/modules-scripting-painless.md). Additional `lang` plugins are available to run scripts written in other languages. You can specify the language of the script anywhere that scripts run.


## Available scripting languages [scripting-available-languages] 

Painless is purpose-built for {{es}}, can be used for any purpose in the scripting APIs, and provides the most flexibility. The other languages are less flexible, but can be useful for specific purposes.
