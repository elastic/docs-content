# Reporting and sharing

% What needs to be done: Refine

% Scope notes: reference prod considerations

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/kibana/kibana/reporting-getting-started.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/kibana/kibana/secure-reporting.md
%      Notes: (as prereqs?)

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$install-reporting-packages$$$

$$$set-reporting-server-host$$$

$$$csv-limitations$$$

$$$embed-code$$$

$$$grant-user-access-basic$$$

$$$grant-user-access-external-provider$$$

$$$grant-user-access$$$

$$$reporting-elasticsearch-configuration$$$

$$$reporting-roles-user-api$$$

$$$securing-reporting$$$
