# AI chat experiences

AI chat can help with a wide range of tasks throughout {{kib}}, such as helping to answer questions about your data, suggesting next steps, and explaining how to use Elastic's software.

There are two AI chat experiences which you can choose from: AI Agent (powered by Agent Builder) and AI Assistant. To learn more about either of them, refer to [](/explore-analyze/ai-features/elastic-agent-builder.md) or [](/explore-analyze/ai-features/ai-chat-experiences/ai-assistant.md). To compare them and learn how to switch between them, refer to [](/explore-analyze/ai-features/ai-chat-experiences/ai-agent-or-ai-assistant.md).
