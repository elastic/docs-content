# Switch to AI Agent

AI Agent is a technical preview chat experience designed to replace Elastic Assistant for {{observability}} & Search and Elastic Assistant for Security. 

AI Agent is built on Elastic's [Agent Builder](/solutions/search/elastic-agent-builder.md) platform. It enables a more cohesive AI chat experience across all Elastic's products, and lets you design your own purpose-built agents. You can create agents for use in different workflows, and give them precise access to the tools and data they need. 

## Enable AI Agent

While AI Agent is in technical preview, the existing AI Assistants remain the default chat experiences for Observability and Security.
