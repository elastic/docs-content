# Building dashboards [create-dashboards]

{{kib}} offers many ways to build powerful dashboards that will help you visualize and keep track of the most important information contained in your {{es}} data.

* Create and assemble visualizations such as charts or maps, and enrich them with helpful legends containing key data.
* Extract and show key indicators and metrics to keep them visible and highlighted at all times.
* Add text, images, and links to help viewers make the most of your dashboard.
* Include additional controls to facilitate filtering and browsing the data.

To create or edit dashboards, you first need to:

* have [data indexed into {{es}}](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/getting-started-index.html) and a [data view](../find-and-organize/data-views.md). A data view is a subset of your {{es}} data, and allows you to load just the right data when building a visualization or exploring it.
    
  ::::{tip}
  If you don’t have data at hand and still want to explore dashboards, you can import one of the [sample data sets](../../manage-data/ingest/sample-data.md) available.
  ::::

* have sufficient permissions on the **Dashboard** feature. If that’s not the case, you might get a read-only indicator. A {{kib}} administrator can [grant you the required privileges](../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/kibana-privileges.md).
