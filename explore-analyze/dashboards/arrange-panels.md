# Organize dashboard panels [arrange-panels]

## Arrange panels in collapsible sections [collapsible-sections]
```{applies_to}
stack: ga 9.1
serverless: ga
```

Organize your dashboard panels into collapsible sections to improve readability and navigation, especially for dashboards with many panels. Collapsible sections also help dashboards load faster by only loading the content from expanded sections.

To add a collapsible section:

1. Open the dashboard and make sure that you are in **Edit** mode.
2. Select **Add panel** and select **Collapsible section**. The collapsible section is added at the end of the dashboard.
3. Optionally, edit the label of the section.
4. Drag and drop any panels you want into the section.
   :::{tip}
   The section must be expanded in order to place panels into it.
   :::
5. Just like any other panel, you can drag and drop the collapsible section to a different position in the dashboard.
6. Save the dashboard. 

Users viewing the dashboard will find the section in the same state as when you saved the dashboard. If you saved it with the section collapsed, then it will also be collapsed by default for users.

## Move and resize panels [resizing-containers]

Compare the data in your panels side-by-side, organize panels by priority, resize the panels so they all appear immediately on the dashboard, and more.

In the toolbar, click **Edit**, then use the following options:

* To move, hover over the panel, click and hold ![The move control icon](/explore-analyze/images/kibana-move-control.png "The move control icon =4%x4%") and drag to the new location. Your screen scrolls automatically when you drag above or below the visible parts of the dashboard.
* To resize, click and hold the bottom right corner of the panel and drag to the new dimensions.
* To maximize to full screen, open the panel menu and click **Maximize**.
