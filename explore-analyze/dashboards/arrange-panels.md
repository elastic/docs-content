# Organize dashboard panels [arrange-panels]

## Move and resize panels [resizing-containers]

Compare the data in your panels side-by-side, organize panels by priority, resize the panels so they all appear immediately on the dashboard, and more.

In the toolbar, click **Edit**, then use the following options:

* To move, hover over the panel, click and hold ![The move control icon](../../images/kibana-move-control.png ""), then drag to the new location.
* To resize, click the resize control, then drag to the new dimensions.
* To maximize to full screen, open the panel menu and click **Maximize**.

  ::::{tip}
  If you [share](sharing.md) a dashboard while viewing a full screen panel, the generated link will directly open the same panel in full screen mode.

## Copy and duplicate panels [duplicate-panels]

To duplicate a panel and the configured functionality, use the clone and copy panel options. Cloned and copied panels replicate all of the functionality from the original panel, including renaming, editing, and cloning.


#### Duplicate panels [clone-panels]

Duplicated panels appear next to the original panel, and move the other panels to provide a space on the dashboard.

1. In the toolbar, click **Edit**.
2. Open the panel menu and select **Duplicate**.


#### Copy panels [copy-to-dashboard]

Copy panels from one dashboard to another dashboard.

1. Open the panel menu and select **Copy to dashboard**.
2. On the **Copy to dashboard** window, select the dashboard, then click **Copy and go to dashboard**.
