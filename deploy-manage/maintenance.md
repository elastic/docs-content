# Maintenance [maintenance]

This section outlines the key tasks and processes required to maintain a healthy, performant, and secure {{es}} infrastructure and its deployments.

The topics covered include:

* **[ECE Maintenance](maintenance/ece.md)**: Explains the procedures for maintaining both the host infrastructure and {{es}} deployments within Elastic Cloud Enterprise (ECE).
* **[Start and Stop services](maintenance/start-stop-services.md)**: Provides step-by-step instructions on how to safely start and stop your {{es}} deployment or {{kib}} instance, particularly when performing actions that require a restart.
* **[Add and remove {{es}} nodes](maintenance/add-and-remove-elasticsearch-nodes.md)**: Guides you through the process of enrolling new nodes or safely removing existing ones from a self-managed {{es}} cluster to optimize resource utilization and cluster performance.
