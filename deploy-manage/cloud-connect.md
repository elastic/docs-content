# Cloud Connect

Cloud Connect enables you to use {{ecloud}} services in your ECE, ECK, or self-managed cluster without having to install and maintain their infrastructure yourself. In this way, you can get faster access to new features while significantly reducing your operational overhead.

AutoOps is the first service available for use with Cloud Connect. More services are coming soon.

## AutoOps

[AutoOps](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops.md) is a monitoring tool that helps you manage your cluster with real-time issue detection, performance recommendations, and resolution paths. By analyzing hundreds of {{es}} metrics, your configuration, and your usage patterns, AutoOps recommends operational and monitoring insights that deliver real savings in administration time and hardware cost.
