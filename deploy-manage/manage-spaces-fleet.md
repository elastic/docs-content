# Using Spaces with {{fleet}} [spaces-fleet]

Fleet supports a **space-aware** data model. You can use [Kibana spaces](/deploy-manage/manage-spaces.md) to manage Agent policies and integrations per space. Combined with granular user roles, this feature enables true role-based access control for {{agent}} management.

For **new deployments** on 9.1.0 or later, space awareness is enabled by default.
For **upgraded deployments** from earlier versions, you must explicitly [enable space awareness](#spaces-fleet-enable).

To use space awareness with {{fleet}}:

- [Enable the space awareness feature](#spaces-fleet-enable)
- [Assign and manage Agent policies across spaces](#spaces-manage-policies)
- [Make integration assets available across spaces](#spaces-manage-assets)

## Enable space awareness in Fleet [spaces-fleet-enable]

You must enable space awareness for deployments upgraded to 9.1.0 or later. Space awareness requires a one-time migration that copies your existing {{fleet}} data into a new, space-aware model. Previous data is preserved in snapshots in case you need to roll back.

To enable space awareness in upgraded deployments:

1. Navigate to the **Fleet** app.
2. Click the **Settings** tab.
3. Scroll to **Advanced settings**.
4. Under **Migrate to space-aware agent policies**, click **Start migration**.
5. Confirm the migration.


## Manage Agent policies across spaces [spaces-manage-policies]

To control where an Agent Policy is available:

1. Navigate to the Agent Policy’s **Settings** tab.

2. Use the **Spaces** dropdown to select one or more spaces.

Agent policies can be assigned to multiple spaces. In this example, the policy is visible in both the "Default" space and "My second space."

Access to a policy is still governed by each user's {{fleet}} permissions within selected spaces.

## Manage integration assets across spaces [spaces-manage-assets]

When you add an integration to an Agent policy, assets such as dashboards and visualizations are installed **only in the current space** by default.

If the Agent Policy spans multiple spaces, install the integration's assets in each space manually:

1. Switch to the desired Kibana space.
2. Go to the **Integrations** app > **Installed integrations** tab.
3. Click the name of the integration.

   :alt: Installed integrations list
   :screenshot:
   :::

4. Open the **Assets** tab.

   :::{image} /deploy-manage/images/kibana-space-add-asset.png
   :alt: Kibana Assets tab
   :screenshot:
   :::

5. Click **Install Kibana assets in current space**.

  This installs dashboards and other UI assets into the selected space.

:::{note}
Due to limitations in Kibana’s saved object model, integration assets are copied per space. These saved objects are considered **managed** and are **readonly**.
