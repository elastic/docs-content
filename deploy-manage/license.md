# Manage your license  

Your Elastic license determines which features are available and what level of support you receive. 

Depending on your deployment type, licenses and subscriptions are applied at different levels:

* For {{ece}}, {{ecloud}}, and {{eck}}: Licenses and subscriptions are controlled at the orchestrator or organization level, and apply to all related deployments.
* For self-managed {{es}}: Licenses are controlled at the cluster level, and apply only to a single cluster.

For a comprehensive comparison of the available subscription levels, see [Elastic subscriptions](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions).

Use the topics in this section to manage your license or start a trial:  

- [{{ece}}](/deploy-manage/license/manage-your-license-in-ece.md)  
- [{{eck}}](/deploy-manage/license/manage-your-license-in-eck.md)  
- [Self-managed cluster](/deploy-manage/license/manage-your-license-in-self-managed-cluster.md)  

## Licensing APIs

You can also manage your license or start a trial using the [licensing APIs](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/group/endpoint-license).
