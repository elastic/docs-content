# Kibana reporting configuration

% What needs to be done: Refine

% GitHub issue: ??? PENDING TO ADD THE TASK TO AN ISSUE

% Scope notes: Reporting documentation will be a bit spread: - how to use reporting in Explore and Analyze - how to configure reporting in Kibana configuration. - Reporting troubleshooting in troubleshooting. - All reporting settings in reference.  The content linked is applicable to all deployment types but certaion parts are only valid for self-managed, so we need to find the best way to present this in the new IA.
