# Network policies [k8s-network-policies]

Kubernetes [network policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) allow you to isolate pods by restricting incoming and outgoing network connections to a trusted set of sources and destinations.

This section describes how to use network policies to isolate the ECK operator and the {{stack}} applications to a set of namespaces to implement a form of soft multi-tenancy. Soft multi-tenancy is a term used to describe a scenario where a group of trusted users (different teams within an organization, for example) share a single resource such as a Kubernetes cluster.

Note that network policies alone are not sufficient for security. You should complement them with strict RBAC policies, resource quotas, node taints, and other available security mechanisms to ensure that tenants cannot access, modify, or disrupt resources belonging to each other.

::::{note} 
There are several efforts to support multi-tenancy on Kubernetes, including the [official working group for multi-tenancy](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/multi-tenancy) and community extensions such as [loft](https://loft.sh) and [kiosk](https://github.com/kiosk-sh/kiosk), that can make configuration and management easier. You might need to employ network policies such the ones described in this section to have fine-grained control over {{stack}} applications deployed by your tenants.
::::

The following sections assume that the operator is installed in the `elastic-system` namespace with the [`namespaces` configuration](configure-eck.md) set to `team-a,team-b`. Each namespace is expected to be labelled as follows:

```sh
kubectl label namespace elastic-system eck.k8s.elastic.co/operator-name=elastic-operator
kubectl label namespace team-a eck.k8s.elastic.co/tenant=team-a
kubectl label namespace team-b eck.k8s.elastic.co/tenant=team-b
```

## Prerequisites [k8s_prerequisites]

To set up the network policies correctly you must know the operator Pod selector and the Kubernetes API server IP. They may vary depending on your environment and how the operator has been installed.

### Operator Pod selector [k8s_operator_pod_selector]

The operator Pod label depends on how the operator has been installed. Check the following table to know which label name is used in the network policies.

| Installation method | Pod selector |
| --- | --- |
| YAML manifests | `control-plane: elastic-operator`<br> |
| Helm Charts | `app.kubernetes.io/name: elastic-operator`<br> |

::::{note} 
The examples in this section assume that the ECK operator has been installed using the Helm chart.
::::

### Kubernetes API server IP [k8s_kubernetes_api_server_ip]

Run `kubectl get endpoints kubernetes -n default` to obtain the API server IP address for your cluster.

::::{note} 
The following examples assume that the Kubernetes API server IP address is `10.0.0.1`.
