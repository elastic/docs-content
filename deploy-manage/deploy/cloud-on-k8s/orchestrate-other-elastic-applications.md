# Orchestrate other Elastic applications

This section explains how to deploy and configure various {{stack}} applications within {{eck}} (ECK).

::::{tip}
This content applies to {{eck_resources_list_short}} applications. To orchestrate an {{es}} cluster or {{kib}}, refer to [](./manage-deployments.md).
::::

The following guides provide specific instructions for deploying and configuring each application on ECK:
* [APM Server](apm-server.md)
* [Standalone Elastic Agent](standalone-elastic-agent.md)
* [{{fleet}}-managed {{agent}}](fleet-managed-elastic-agent.md)
* [Elastic Maps Server](elastic-maps-server.md)
* [Beats](beats.md)
* [{{ls}}](logstash.md)

::::{note}
Enterprise Search is not available in {{stack}} versions 9.0 and later. To deploy or manage Enterprise Search in earlier versions, refer to the [previous ECK documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-on-k8s/2.16/k8s-enterprise-search.html).

* [{{stack}} configuration policies](elastic-stack-configuration-policies.md)
* [Upgrade the {{stack}} version](../../upgrade/deployment-or-cluster.md)
