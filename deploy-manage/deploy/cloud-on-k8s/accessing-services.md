# Accessing services

% What needs to be done: Refine

% GitHub issue: https://github.com/elastic/docs-projects/issues/357

% Scope notes: Merge the selected docs into one: - First describe how to access Elasticsearch. - Describe the services that ECK creates for ES. - Provide the example and instructions

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud-on-k8s/cloud-on-k8s/k8s-accessing-elastic-services.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud-on-k8s/cloud-on-k8s/k8s-request-elasticsearch-endpoint.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud-on-k8s/cloud-on-k8s/k8s-services.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud-on-k8s/cloud-on-k8s/k8s-security.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$k8s-allow-public-access$$$

$$$k8s-setting-up-your-own-certificate$$$
