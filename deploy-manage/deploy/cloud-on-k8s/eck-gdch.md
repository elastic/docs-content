# Deploy ECK on Google Distributed Hosted Cloud

You can install {{eck}} (ECK) directly from the marketplace available within your Google Distributed Hosted Cloud (GDCH) environment.

:::{note}
The Elastic Package Registry (EPR) container image is not yet available in GDCH and must be deployed manually if you plan to use [integrations](integration-docs://reference/index.md). All other dependencies, such as the Elastic Artifact Registry and Elastic Endpoint Artifact Repository, must also be built and hosted locally as described in the [air-gapped deployment documentation](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/air-gapped-install.md).

For extra guidance on running ECK in isolated environments, refer to [Running ECK in air-gapped environments](/deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-on-k8s/air-gapped-install.md).
:::

## Installation procedure

To install ECK:

1. Open the **Marketplace** in your GDCH console.
2. Search for **Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (BYOL)**.
3. Click **Install**.
4. Select a **user cluster**, review or adjust the installation parameters, and start the installation.

    If you prefer to customize the configuration, refer to the [ECK configuration guide](/deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-on-k8s/configure.md) for details on setting operator parameters in the **Configure the service** page.

Once completed, ECK will be running in your GDCH environment.

Next, open a terminal with `kubectl` and choose one of the following options:

1. [Start a trial](/deploy-manage/license/manage-your-license-in-eck.md#k8s-start-trial) to enable ECK’s enterprise features.
2. Continue using ECK in free & basic mode.
3. [Apply an Enterprise license](/deploy-manage/license/manage-your-license-in-eck.md#k8s-add-license).

## Next steps

When ECK is up and licensed, follow the [ECK Quickstart guide](/deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-on-k8s/elasticsearch-deployment-quickstart.md) to deploy {{es}} and {{kib}} for your use case, whether it’s [Observability](/solutions/observability.md), [Security](/solutions/security.md), or [Search](/solutions/search.md).
