# Configuration examples [k8s-elastic-agent-configuration-examples]

This section contains manifests that illustrate common use cases, and can be your starting point in exploring Elastic Agent deployed with ECK. These manifests are self-contained and work out-of-the-box on any non-secured Kubernetes cluster. They all contain a three-node Elasticsearch cluster and a single Kibana instance. Add the corresponding integration package to Kibana to install the dashboards, visualizations and other assets for each of these examples as described in [the Elastic Agent documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/elastic-agent-installation.html).

::::{warning}
The examples in this section are for illustration purposes only and should not be considered to be production-ready. Some of these examples use the `node.store.allow_mmap: false` setting which has performance implications and should be tuned for production workloads, as described in [Virtual memory](virtual-memory.md).

## System integration [k8s_system_integration]

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s/2.16/config/recipes/elastic-agent/system-integration.yaml
```

Deploys Elastic Agent as a DaemonSet in standalone mode with system integration enabled. Collects syslog logs, auth logs and system metrics (for CPU, I/O, filesystem, memory, network, process and others).


## Kubernetes integration [k8s_kubernetes_integration]

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s/2.16/config/recipes/elastic-agent/kubernetes-integration.yaml
```

Deploys Elastic Agent as a DaemonSet in standalone mode with Kubernetes integration enabled. Collects API server, Container, Event, Node, Pod, Volume and system metrics.


## Multiple Elasticsearch clusters output [k8s_multiple_elasticsearch_clusters_output]

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s/2.16/config/recipes/elastic-agent/multi-output.yaml
```

Deploys two Elasticsearch clusters and two Kibana instances together with single Elastic Agent DaemonSet in standalone mode with System integration enabled. System metrics are sent to the `elasticsearch` cluster. Elastic Agent monitoring data is sent to `elasticsearch-mon` cluster.


## Storing local state in host path volume [k8s_storing_local_state_in_host_path_volume]

{{agent}} managed by ECK stores local state in a host path volume by default. This ensures that {{integrations}} run by the agent can continue their work without duplicating work that has already been done after the Pod has been recreated for example because of a Pod configuration change. Multiple replicas of an agent, for example {{fleet}} Servers, can not be deployed on the same underlying {{k8s}} node as they would try to use the same host path. There are 2 options for managing this feature:

1. If local state storage in `hostPath` volumes is not desired this can be turned off by configuring an `emptyDir` volume instead.
2. If local state storage is still desired but running the Agent container as root is not allowed, then you can run a `DaemonSet` that adjusts the permissions for the Agent local state on each Node prior to running {{agent}}. Note that this `DaemonSet` must be `runAsUser: 0` and possibly `privileged: true`. Also note the {{kib}} changes required to trust the {{es}} CA when running in fleet mode.

Full configuration examples exist in  [Running as a non-root user](configuration-fleet.md#k8s-elastic-agent-running-as-a-non-root-user).
