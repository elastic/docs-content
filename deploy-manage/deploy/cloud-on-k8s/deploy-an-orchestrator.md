# Deploy an orchestrator [k8s-quickstart]

With Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK), you can extend the basic Kubernetes orchestration capabilities to easily deploy, secure, upgrade your {{es}} cluster, along with other Elastic applications.

In this section, you'll learn how to do the following:

- [**Installing the ECK Operator**](./install.md): Learn different installation methods, including Helm and YAML manifests.
- [**Deploying in air-gapped environments**](./air-gapped-install.md): Follow best practices for installing and operating ECK in restricted networks.
- [**Configuring ECK**](./configure.md): Understand the available configuration options to optimize your ECK deployment.

To learn how to deploy {{es}}, {{kib}}, or other Elastic applications using ECK, refer to [](./manage-deployments.md).

::::{tip}
For a quickstart experience covering installation of ECK and deployment of an {{es}} cluster with a {{kib}} instance, refer to [](../cloud-on-k8s.md#eck-quickstart)
