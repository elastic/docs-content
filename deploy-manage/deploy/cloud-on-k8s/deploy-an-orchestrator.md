# Deploy an orchestrator [k8s-quickstart]

With Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK) you can extend the basic Kubernetes orchestration capabilities to easily deploy, secure, upgrade your {{es}} cluster, and much more.

Eager to get started? This quickstart guide shows you how to:

* [Deploy ECK in your Kubernetes cluster](install-using-yaml-manifest-quickstart.md)
* [Deploy an {{es}} cluster](elasticsearch-deployment-quickstart.md)
* [Deploy a {{kib}} instance](kibana-instance-quickstart.md)
* [Update your deployment](update-deployments.md)

Afterwards, you can find further sample resources [in the project repository](https://github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s/tree/2.16/config/samples) or by checking out [our recipes](recipes.md).
