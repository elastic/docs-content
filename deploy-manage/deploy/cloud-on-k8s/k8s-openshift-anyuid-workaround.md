# Deploy Docker images with anyuid SCC [k8s-openshift-anyuid-workaround]

Starting with version 7.9, it is possible to run the APM Server with the `restricted` SCC. For APM versions older than 7.9 and Enterprise Search version 7.9, you can use this workaround which allows the Pod to run with the default `uid 1000` by assigning it to the `anyuid` SCC:

1. Create a service account to run the APM Server:

    ```shell
    oc create serviceaccount apm-server -n elastic
    ```

2. Add the APM service account to the `anyuid` SCC:

    ```shell
    oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z apm-server -n elastic
    ```

    ```shell
    scc "anyuid" added to: ["system:serviceaccount:elastic:apm-server"]
    ```

3. Deploy an APM Server and a `Route` with the following manifest:

    ```shell
    cat <<EOF | oc apply -n elastic -f -
    apiVersion: apm.k8s.elastic.co/v1
    kind: ApmServer
    metadata:
      name: apm-server-sample
    spec:
      version: 8.16.1
      count: 1
      elasticsearchRef:
        name: "elasticsearch-sample"
      podTemplate:
        spec:
          serviceAccountName: apm-server
    ---
    apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
    kind: Route
    metadata:
      name: apm-server-sample
    spec:
      #host: apm-server.example.com # override if you don't want to use the host that is automatically generated by OpenShift (<route-name>[-<namespace>].<suffix>)
      tls:
        termination: passthrough # the APM Server is the TLS endpoint
        insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Redirect
      to:
        kind: Service
        name: apm-server-sample-apm-http
    EOF
    ```

    To check that the Pod of the APM Server is using the correct SCC, use the following command:

    ```shell
    oc get pod -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{$scc := index .metadata.annotations "openshift.io/scc"}}{{.metadata.name}}{{" scc:"}}{{range .spec.containers}}{{$scc}}{{" "}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}'
    ```

    ```shell
    apm-server-sample-apm-server-86bfc5c95c-96lbx scc:anyuid
    elasticsearch-sample-es-5tsqghmm79 scc:restricted
    elasticsearch-sample-es-6qk52mz5jk scc:restricted
    elasticsearch-sample-es-dg4vvpm2mr scc:restricted
    kibana-sample-kb-97c6b6b8d-lqfd2 scc:restricted
    ```
