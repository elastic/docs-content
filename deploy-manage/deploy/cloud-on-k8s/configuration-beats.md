# Configuration [k8s-beat-configuration]

## Upgrade the Beat specification [k8s-beat-upgrade-specification]

You can upgrade the Beat version or change settings by editing the YAML specification. ECK applies the changes by performing a rolling restart of the Beat Pods. Depending on the specification settings that you used, ECK will set the [output](configuration-beats.md#k8s-beat-set-beat-output) part of the config, perform Kibana dashboard [setup](configuration-beats.md#k8s-beat-set-up-kibana-dashboards), restart Beats on certificates rollover and set up the Beats [keystore](configuration-beats.md#k8s-beat-secrets-keystore-for-secure-settings).


## Customize Beat configuration [k8s-beat-custom-configuration]

The Beat configuration is defined in the `config` element:

```yaml
apiVersion: beat.k8s.elastic.co/v1beta1
kind: Beat
metadata:
  name: quickstart
spec:
  type: heartbeat
  version: 8.16.1
  elasticsearchRef:
    name: quickstart
  config:
    heartbeat.monitors:
    - type: tcp
      schedule: '@every 5s'
      hosts: ["quickstart-es-http.default.svc:9200"]
  deployment:
    podTemplate:
      spec:
        dnsPolicy: ClusterFirstWithHostNet
        securityContext:
          runAsUser: 0
```

Alternatively, it can be provided through a Secret specified in the `configRef` element:

```yaml
apiVersion: beat.k8s.elastic.co/v1beta1
kind: Beat
metadata:
  name: heartbeat-quickstart
spec:
  type: heartbeat
  version: 8.16.1
  elasticsearchRef:
    name: quickstart
  configRef:
    secretName: heartbeat-config
  deployment:
    podTemplate:
      spec:
        dnsPolicy: ClusterFirstWithHostNet
        securityContext:
          runAsUser: 0
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: heartbeat-config
stringData:
  beat.yml: |-
    heartbeat.monitors:
    - type: tcp
      schedule: '@every 5s'
      hosts: ["quickstart-es-http.default.svc:9200"]
```

For more details, check the [Beats configuration](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/libbeat/current/config-file-format.html) section.


## Customize the connection to an Elasticsearch cluster [k8s-beat-connect-es]

The `elasticsearchRef` element allows ECK to automatically configure Beats to establish a secured connection to a managed Elasticsearch cluster. By default it targets all nodes in your cluster. If you want to direct traffic to specific nodes of your Elasticsearch cluster, refer to [*Traffic Splitting*](requests-routing-to-elasticsearch-nodes.md) for more information and examples.


## Deploy a Beat [k8s-beat-deploy-elastic-beat]

ECK supports the deployment of the following Beats:

* [Filebeat](https://www.elastic.co/beats/filebeat)
* [Metricbeat](https://www.elastic.co/beats/metricbeat)
* [Heartbeat](https://www.elastic.co/beats/heartbeat)
* [Auditbeat](https://www.elastic.co/beats/auditbeat)
* [Packetbeat](https://www.elastic.co/beats/packetbeat)
* [Journalbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/journalbeat/current/index.html)

For each Beat you want to deploy, you can specify the `type` and `version` elements. ECK creates a new user in Elasticsearch with a minimal set of appropriate roles and permissions to enable the use of all Beats features.


## Deploy a Community Beat [k8s-beat-deploy-community-beat]

ECK supports the deployment of any Community Beat.

1. Specify the `type` and `version` elements.
2. Set the `image` element to point to the image to be deployed.
3. Make sure the following roles exist in Elasticsearch:

    * If `elasticsearchRef` is provided, create the role `eck_beat_es_$type_role`, where `$type` is the Beat type. For example, when deploying `kafkabeat`, the role name is `eck_beat_es_kafkabeat_role`. This role must have the permissions required by the Beat. Check the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/defining-roles.html) for more details.
    * If `kibanaRef` is provided, create the role `eck_beat_kibana_$type_role` with the permissions required to setup Kibana dashboards.


Alternatively, create a user in Elasticsearch and include the credentials in the Beats `config` for Elasticsearch output, Kibana setup or both. If `elasticsearchRef` and `kibanaRef` are also defined, ECK will use the provided user credentials when setting up the connections.


## Set up Kibana dashboards [k8s-beat-set-up-kibana-dashboards]

ECK can instruct Beats to set up example dashboards packaged with the Beat. To enable this, set the `kibanaRef` element in the specification to point to ECK-managed Kibana deployment:

```yaml
apiVersion: beat.k8s.elastic.co/v1beta1
kind: Beat
metadata:
  name: quickstart
spec:
  kibanaRef:
    name: quickstart
...
```

ECK will create a new user in Elasticsearch with a minimal set of appropriate roles and permissions that is needed for dashboard setup.


## Secrets keystore for secure settings [k8s-beat-secrets-keystore-for-secure-settings]

Beats offer a keystore for sensitive settings like passwords. This avoids storing them in plaintext in the configuration.

ECK exposes that mechanism with the `secureSettings` element in the specification. [Similar to Elasticsearch](../../security/secure-settings.md), you can use Kubernetes Secrets to provide the settings securely:

```yaml
apiVersion: beat.k8s.elastic.co/v1beta1
kind: Beat
metadata:
  name: quickstart
spec:
  secureSettings:
  - secretName: agent-name-secret
  config:
    name: ${AGENT_NAME_VAR}
...
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: agent-name-secret
stringData:
  AGENT_NAME_VAR: id_007
```

Check [Beats documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/keystore.html) for more details.


## Set Beat output [k8s-beat-set-beat-output]

If the `elasticsearchRef` element is specified, ECK populates the output section of the Beat config. ECK creates a user with appropriate roles and permissions and uses its credentials. If required, it also mounts the CA certificate in all Beat Pods, and recreates Pods when this certificate changes. Moreover, `elasticsearchRef` element can refer to an ECK-managed Elasticsearch cluster by filling the `name`, `namespace`, `serviceName` fields accordingly, as well as to a Kubernetes secret that contains the connection information to an Elasticsearch cluster not managed by it. In the latter case, for authenticating against the Elasticsearch cluster the secret must contain the fields of `url` and either the `username` with `password` or the `api-key`.

Output can be set to any value that is supported by a given Beat. To use it, remove the `elasticsearchRef` element from the specification and include an appropriate output configuration in the `config` or `configRef` elements.

```yaml
apiVersion: beat.k8s.elastic.co/v1beta1
kind: Beat
metadata:
  name: quickstart
spec:
  config:
    output.kafka:
      hosts: ["kafka1.default.svc:9092", "kafka2.default.svc:9092"]
      topic: '%{[fields.log_topic]}'
      partition.round_robin:
        reachable_only: false
      required_acks: 1
...
```


## Choose the deployment model [k8s-beat-chose-the-deployment-model]

Depending on the use case, Beats may need to be deployed as a [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) or a [DaemonSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/). Provide a `podTemplate` element under either the `deployment` or the `daemonSet` element in the specification to choose how a given Beat should be deployed. When choosing the `deployment` option you can additionally specify the [strategy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#strategy) used to replace old Pods with new ones.

```yaml
apiVersion: beat.k8s.elastic.co/v1beta1
kind: Beat
metadata:
  name: quickstart
spec:
  deployment:
    strategy:
      type: Recreate
    podTemplate:
      spec:
        securityContext:
          runAsUser: 0
```

Consider picking the `Recreate` strategy if you are using a `hostPath` volume as the Beats data directory to avoid two Pods competing for the same directory.


## Role Based Access Control for Beats [k8s-beat-role-based-access-control-for-beats]

Some Beats features (such as [autodiscover](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/configuration-autodiscover.html) or Kubernetes module [metricsets](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/current/metricbeat-metricset-kubernetes-apiserver.html)) require that Beat Pods interact with Kubernetes APIs. Specific permissions are needed to allow this functionality. Standard Kubernetes [RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) rules apply. For example, to allow for autodiscover:

```yaml
apiVersion: beat.k8s.elastic.co/v1beta1
kind: Beat
metadata:
  name: quickstart
spec:
  config:
    filebeat:
      autodiscover:
        providers:
        - node: ${NODE_NAME}
          type: kubernetes
          hints:
            enabled: true
            default_config:
              type: container
              paths:
              - /var/log/containers/*${data.kubernetes.container.id}.log
  daemonSet:
    podTemplate:
      spec:
        serviceAccount: elastic-beat-filebeat-quickstart
        automountServiceAccountToken: true
        containers:
        - name: filebeat
          env:
          - name: NODE_NAME
            valueFrom:
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: spec.nodeName
...

## Deploying Beats in secured clusters [k8s-beat-deploying-beats-in-secured-clusters]

To deploy Beats in clusters with the Pod Security Policy admission controller enabled, or [in OpenShift clusters](k8s-openshift-beats.md), you must grant additional permissions to the Service Account used by the Beat Pods. Those Service Accounts must be bound to a Role or ClusterRole that has `use` permission for the required Pod Security Policy or Security Context Constraints. Different Beats and their features might require different settings set in their PSP/[SCC](k8s-openshift-beats.md).
