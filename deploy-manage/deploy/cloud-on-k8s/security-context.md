# Security context [k8s-security-context]

In Kubernetes, a [`securityContext`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/) defines privilege and access control settings for a Pod or Container. You can set up it through the `podTemplate` section of an Elastic resource specification.

## Default Elasticsearch security context [k8s_default_elasticsearch_security_context]

As of version 8.8.0, the Elasticsearch container and ECK managed sidecars and init containers are running with the following security context:

```yaml
securityContext:
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  capabilities:
    drop:
    - ALL
  privileged: false
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true <1>
```

1. `readOnlyRootFilesystem` is only enabled if the `elasticsearch-data` directory is mounted in a volume.



## Running older versions of Elasticsearch as non-root [k8s_running_older_versions_of_elasticsearch_as_non_root]

::::{note} 
when running on Red Hat OpenShift a random user ID is [automatically assigned](https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/a-guide-to-openshift-and-uids) and the following instructions do not apply.

In versions of Elasticsearch before 8.0.0, the Elastisearch container is run as root and its entrypoint is responsible to run the Elasticsearch process with the `elasticsearch` user (defined with ID 1000). In the background, ECK uses an `initContainer` to make sure that the data volume is writable for the `elasticsearch` user.

To run the Elastisearch container as a non-root user, you need to configure the Elasticsearch manifest with an appropriate security context to make the data volume writable to the `elasticsearch` user by specifying the right group ID through the `fsGroup`.

Kubernetes recursively changes ownership and permissions for the contents of each volume to match the `fsGroup` specified in a Podâ€™s securityContext when that volume is mounted and makes all processes of the containers part of the supplementary group ID.

For example, if you force the Pod to run as user `1234`, you need to set `fsGroup` accordingly to `1234`:

```yaml
apiVersion: elasticsearch.k8s.elastic.co/v1
kind: Elasticsearch
metadata:
  name: quickstart
spec:
  version: 8.16.1
spec:
  nodeSets:
  - name: default
    count: 3
    podTemplate:
      spec:
        securityContext:
          runAsUser: 1234 <1>
          fsGroup: 1234 <2>
```

1. Any containers in the Pod run all processes with user ID `1234`.
2. All processes are also part of the supplementary group ID `1234`, that owns the Pod volumes.
