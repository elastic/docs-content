# Configure deployments [k8s-orchestrating-elastic-stack-applications]

This section provides details around {{kib}} and {{es}} configuration when running on ECK. For general information about how ECK applies configuration changes and the syntax to use in the YAML manifests, refer to [](./update-deployments.md).

* [**{{es}} configuration**](elasticsearch-configuration.md): Review configuration possibilities to tune your {{es}} cluster running on ECK, learn how [nodes orchestration](./nodes-orchestration.md) work, [storage recommendations](./storage-recommendations.md), and more.

* [**{{kib}} configuration**](kibana-configuration.md): Learn how to connect {{kib}} to an {{es}} cluster, apply advanced configuration settings, and tune the HTTP configuration.

Additionally, the following topics apply to both {{es}} and {{kib}}, and in some cases, to other applications supported by ECK:

* [**Access services**](accessing-services.md): Learn how to access to the orchestrated clusters and how to adapt the Kubernetes services to your needs.

* [**Customize Pods**](customize-pods.md): Learn how to adapt the `podTemplate` field to your needs.

* [**Manage compute resources**](manage-compute-resources.md): Important considerations around CPU and memory `requests` and `limits` when running production workloads.

* [**Recipes**](recipes.md): Advanced use cases examples available in our GitHub repository. 

* [**Connect to external Elastic resources**](connect-to-external-elastic-resources.md): Use custom `secrets` for the `elasticsearchRef` and `kibanaRef` parameters.

ECK also facilitates configuration and operation activities with advanced features, such as:

* [**Elastic Stack configuration policies**](elastic-stack-configuration-policies.md): Organize your {{es}} and {{kib}} configuration settings through `StackConfigPolicy` resources that can be referenced within your deployments. This helps to keep your manifests simplified.
