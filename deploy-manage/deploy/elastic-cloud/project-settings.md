# Project settings

% What needs to be done: Refine

% GitHub issue: https://github.com/elastic/docs-projects/issues/337

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/project-and-management-settings.md
%      Notes: anything that isn't deduplicated from
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/elasticsearch-manage-project.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$elasticsearch-manage-project-search-ai-lake-settings$$$

$$$elasticsearch-manage-project-search-power-settings$$$

$$$project-features-add-ons$$$

**This page is a work in progress.** The documentation team is working to combine content pulled from the following pages:

* [/raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/project-and-management-settings.md](/raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/project-and-management-settings.md)
* [/raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/elasticsearch-manage-project.md](/raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/elasticsearch-manage-project.md)
