% What needs to be done: Refine

% GitHub issue: https://github.com/elastic/docs-projects/issues/336

% Scope notes: merge

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud/ec-getting-started-trial.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/general-sign-up-trial.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud/ec-getting-started-existing-email.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$general-sign-up-trial-what-is-included-in-my-trial$$$
