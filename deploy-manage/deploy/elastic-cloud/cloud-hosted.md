# Cloud Hosted

% What needs to be done: Refine

% GitHub issue: https://github.com/elastic/docs-projects/issues/338

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud/ec-getting-started.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud/ec-prepare-production.md
%      Notes: link roundup is good but the plan for prod content is not needed here
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud/ec-faq-getting-started.md
%      Notes: extract what we can from faq
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud/ec-about.md
%      Notes: redirect only
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud-heroku/ech-configure.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$faq-full-stack$$$
