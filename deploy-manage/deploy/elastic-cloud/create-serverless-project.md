# Create a serverless project [serverless-get-started]

There are two options to create serverless projects:

* If you are a new user, [sign up for a free 14-day trial](https://cloud.elastic.co/serverless-registration) to create a serverless project. For more information about the {{ecloud}} trials, check [Trial features](create-an-organization.md#general-sign-up-trial-what-is-included-in-my-trial).
* If you are an existing customer, [log in to {{ecloud}}](https://cloud.elastic.co/login). On the home page, you will see a new option to create serverless projects.

Choose the type of project that matches your needs and we’ll help you get started with our solution guides.
