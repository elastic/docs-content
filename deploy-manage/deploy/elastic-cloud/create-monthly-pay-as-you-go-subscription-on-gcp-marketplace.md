# Create a monthly pay-as-you-go subscription on GCP Marketplace [ec-gcp-marketplace-conversion]

When subscribing to an annual prepaid subscription to {{ecloud}} on GCP Marketplace, follow these instructions to obtain a separate pay-as-you-go subscription. This subscription will allow us to continue your {{ecloud}} service through the Marketplace once the contract is expired. You will not get charged twice for the usage under the annual contract.

1. Go to the [GCP Marketplace listing page for {{ecloud}} pay-as-you-go](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/elastic-prod/elastic-cloud).
2. Click **Subscribe** to create a GCP Marketplace subscription under the selected GCP Billing Account.

No further steps required in GCP. You do not need to register for a new {{ecloud}} organization if you are already using {{ecloud}}.

You should now see the monthly *Pay as you go* subscription for {{ecloud}} in your [GCP Marketplace Orders page](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/orders).
