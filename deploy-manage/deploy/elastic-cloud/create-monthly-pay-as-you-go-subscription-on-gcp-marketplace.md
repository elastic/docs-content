# Create a monthly pay-as-you-go subscription on GCP Marketplace [ec-gcp-marketplace-conversion]

When subscribing to an annual prepaid subscription to Elastic Cloud on GCP Marketplace, please follow these instructions to obtain a separate pay-as-you-go subscription. This subscription will allow us to continue your Elastic Cloud service through the Marketplace once the contract is expired. You will not get charged twice for the usage under the annual contract.

1. Go to the [GCP Marketplace listing page for Elastic Cloud pay-as-you-go](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/elastic-prod/elastic-cloud).
2. Click **Subscribe** to create a GCP Marketplace subscription under the selected GCP Billing Account.

No further steps required in GCP. You do not need to register for a new Elastic Cloud organization if you are already using Elastic Cloud.

You should now see the monthly *Pay as you go* subscription for Elastic Cloud in your [GCP Marketplace Orders page](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/orders).
