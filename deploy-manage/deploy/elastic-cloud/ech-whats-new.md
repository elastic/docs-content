# What���s new with the Elastic Stack [ech-whats-new]

As soon as the latest Elastic Stack version is released, we make it available to you.

From the [Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body), you can upgrade your existing deployments to the latest versions of the Elastic Stack. To learn more about the best practices to use when upgrading, refer to [Upgrade versions](../../upgrade/deployment-or-cluster.md).

Check our [Version policy](ech-version-policy.md) to learn about when and how new Elastic Stack versions are made available.
