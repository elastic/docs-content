# Tools and APIs

% What needs to be done: Write from scratch

% GitHub issue: https://github.com/elastic/docs-projects/issues/310

% Scope notes: elastic cloud control  does this work for serverless/cloud together?

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

## REST APIs to orchestrate {{ecloud}}

The following APIs allow you to manage your {{ecloud}} organization, users, security, billing and resources.

:::::{tab-set}
:group: serverless-hosted

::::{tab-item} {{serverless-short}}
:sync: serverless

You can use the [{{serverless-full}} APIs](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elastic-cloud-serverless) to manage your {{serverless-full}} projects, your organization, and its users.

::::
::::{tab-item} {{ech}}
:sync: hosted

You can use the [{{ecloud}} API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/cloud/) to manage your hosted deployments and all of the resources associated with them. This includes performing deployment CRUD operations, scaling or autoscaling resources, and managing traffic filters, deployment extensions, remote clusters, and Elastic Stack versions. You can also access cost data by deployment and by organization.

## REST APIs to interact with data and solution features

The following APIs allow you to interact with your {{es}} cluster, its data, and the features available to you in your hosted deployment or serverless project.

Note that some [restrictions](/deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/restrictions-known-problems.md#ec-restrictions-apis-elasticsearch) apply when using the these APIs on {{ecloud}}.

:::::{tab-set}
:group: serverless-hosted
::::{tab-item} {{serverless-short}}
:sync: serverless

**API references**

The following APIs are available for {{es-serverless}} users. These links will take you to the autogenerated API reference documentation.

- [Elasticsearch Serverless APIs](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch-serverless): Use these APIs to index, manage, search, and analyze your data in {{es-serverless}}. Learn how to [connect to your {{es-serverless}} endpoint](/solutions/search/get-started.md).
- [Kibana Serverless APIs](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/serverless): Use these APIs to manage resources such as connectors, data views, and saved objects for your {{serverless-full}} project.


**Additional API information**

- [{{es}} API conventions](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/serverless/current/elasticsearch-api-conventions.html): Reference information about headers and request body conventions for {{es-serverless}} REST APIs.
- [Management API conventions](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/serverless/current/elasticsearch-kibana-api-conventions.html): Reference information about request header conventions for {{serverless-full}} REST APIs.
::::

::::{tab-item} {{ech}}
:sync: hosted

- [Elasticsearch APIs](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/): This set of APIs allows you to interact directly with the Elasticsearch nodes in your deployment. You can ingest data, run search queries, check the health of your clusters, manage snapshots, and more.
- [Kibana APIs](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/kibana/): Many Kibana features can be accessed through these APIs, including Kibana objects, patterns, and dashboards, as well as user roles and user sessions. You can use these APIs to configure alerts and actions, and to access health details for the Kibana Task Manager.

## {{ecloud}} API Console
```{applies_to}
deployment:
  ess: ga
serverless: unavailable
```

For each deployment, an **API Console** page is available from the {{ecloud}} Console for you to execute queries using the available APIs. You can find this console when selecting a specific deployment to manage. From there, the API Console is available under the **{{es}}** page.

:::{note}
This API Console is different from the [Dev Tools Console](/explore-analyze/query-filter/tools/console.md) available in each deployment, from which you can call {{es}} and {{kib}} APIs. On the {{ecloud}} API Console, you cannot run Kibana APIs.

## ECCTL - Command-line interface for {{ecloud}}

ecctl is the command-line interface for {{ecloud}} APIs. It wraps typical operations commonly needed by operators within a single command line tool.

Benefits of ecctl:

- Easier to use than the Cloud UI or using the RESTful API directly
- Helps you automate the deployment lifecycle
- Provides a foundation for integration with other tools

Find more details in the [ecctl documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecctl/current/index.html).

## Monitor your deployments with AutoOps
```{applies_to}
deployment:
  ess: ga
serverless: unavailable
```

AutoOps significantly simplifies cluster management for your {{ech}} deployments with performance recommendations, resource utilization visibility, real-time issue detection and resolution paths. Find more details in [](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops.md)


## Provision hosted deployments with Terraform
```{applies_to}
deployment:
  ess: ga
serverless: unavailable
```

The Elastic Cloud Terraform provider allows you to provision {{ech}} deployments on any Elastic Cloud platform, whether itâ€™s {{ecloud}} or Elastic Cloud Enterprise.

The provider lets you manage Elastic Cloud deployments as code, and introduce DevOps-driven methodologies to manage and deploy the Elastic Stack and solutions.

To get started, see the [Elastic Cloud Terraform provider documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/elastic/ec/latest/docs).
