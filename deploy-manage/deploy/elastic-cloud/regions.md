# Regions [regions]

A region is the geographic area where the data center of the cloud provider that hosts your project is located. Review the available {{serverless-full}} regions to decide which region to use. If you arenâ€™t sure which region to pick, choose one that is geographically close to you to reduce latency.

{{serverless-full}} handles all hosting details for you. You are unable to change the region after you create a project.

::::{note} 
Currently, a limited number of Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) regions are available. More regions for AWS, Azure, and GCP, will be added in the future.

## Marketplaces

When procuring {{ecloud}} through [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-voru33wi6xs7k), [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/elastic.ec-azure-pp?tab=overview), or [GCP Marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/elastic-prod/elastic-cloud), only the regions corresponding to the same cloud service provider can be used. This ensures that you can enjoy the benefits of the marketplace, such as {{ecloud}} contributing towards your spend commitment with cloud providers.

You can implement a multi-cloud strategy by creating a separate {{ecloud}} organization, either from another marketplace, or directly at [cloud.elastic.co](https://cloud.elastic.co).
For example, if you have created a project in `eu-central-1` after signing up on AWS Marketplace, you can provision another project in GCP `europe-west1` by signing up for a second {{ecloud}} organization on GCP Marketplace, using another email address.
