# Access the Elasticsearch API console [ech-api-console]

Interact with a specific Elasticsearch cluster directly from the [Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body) without having to authenticate again. This RESTful API access is limited to the specific cluster and works only for Elasticsearch API calls.

::::{note} 
API console is intended for admin purposes. Avoid running normal workload like indexing or search request.

You are unable to make Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku platform changes from the Elasticsearch API.

1. Log in to the [Elasticsearch Add-On for Heroku console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
2. On the deployments page, select your deployment.

    Narrow your deployments by name, ID, or choose from several other filters. To customize your view, use a combination of filters, or change the format from a grid to a list.

3. From the Elasticsearch menu, go to the **API Console** page.
4. Make a selection from the operation drop-down list and complete the path.

    For example, select `GET`, then use the `_cluster/health?pretty=true` path for cluster status and other pertinent details.

5. If needed, add the body information.

    ::::{tip} 
    To display the body area, select PUT, POST, or DELETE from the drop-down list.
    ::::

6. Select **Submit**.

The results of the API operation are displayed, along with the time it took to complete the operation.
