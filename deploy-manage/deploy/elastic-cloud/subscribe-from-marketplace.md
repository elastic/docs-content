# Subscribe from a marketplace [ec-marketplaces]

You can subscribe to {{ecloud}} from a marketplace. Your subscription gets billed together with other services that youâ€™re already using, and can contribute towards your spend commitment with cloud providers.

Trial availability and duration can vary depending on the marketplace.

When subscribing from a marketplace, your marketplace email is used for your [Elastic account](../../../cloud-account/update-your-email-address.md).

* [AWS Marketplace](aws-marketplace.md)
* [Azure Marketplace](azure-native-isv-service.md)
* [GCP Marketplace](google-cloud-platform-marketplace.md)
* [Heroku](heroku.md)

::::{note}
[Serverless projects](https://docs.elastic.co/serverless) are only available for the AWS Marketplace, and are in technical preview on the Azure Marketplace. Support for GCP Marketplace will be added in the near future.
