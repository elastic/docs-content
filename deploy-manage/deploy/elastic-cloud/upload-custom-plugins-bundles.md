# Upload custom plugins and bundles

% What needs to be done: Lift-and-shift

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud/ec-custom-bundles.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud-heroku/ech-custom-bundles.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$ec-add-your-plugin$$$

$$$ec-update-bundles-and-plugins$$$

$$$ec-update-bundles$$$

$$$ech-add-your-plugin$$$

$$$ech-update-bundles-and-plugins$$$

$$$ech-update-bundles$$$
