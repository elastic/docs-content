# Change hardware profiles [ec-change-hardware-profile]

Deployment [hardware profiles](ec-configure-deployment-settings.md#ec-hardware-profiles) deploy the Elastic Stack on virtual hardware. Each hardware profile has a different blend of storage, RAM, and vCPU.

Elastic Cloud regularly introduces new hardware profiles to provide:

* More optimal hardware for applications in the Elastic Stack.
* Cost efficiencies when new hardware from Cloud providers becomes available.

::::{tip}
The Elastic Cloud console indicates when a new version of a hardware profile is available in the overview page for your deployment, under the Hardware profile section.
::::


## Change the hardware profile using the Elastic Cloud console [ec_change_the_hardware_profile_using_the_elastic_cloud_console]

### Upgrade to the newest version of your current hardware profile [ec_upgrade_to_the_newest_version_of_your_current_hardware_profile]

Note that if there’s no indication that a newer version is available, that means that your deployment is already running on the latest version of that hardware profile.

1. On the deployment overview page, next to your current hardware profile where there is indication of a newer available version, select **Edit**.

2. Preview the changes for the new hardware profile version.

3. Select **Update** to apply the change.


### Change to a different hardware profile [ec_change_to_a_different_hardware_profile]

When the current hardware profile of your deployment isn’t the most optimal one available for your usage, you can change it as follows:

1. On the deployment overview page, next to your current hardware profile, select **Edit**.
2. Select the hardware profile you wish to change to. The configuration screen summarizes hardware changes for each component of your deployment.

    :::{image} ../../../images/cloud-ec-preview-different-profile-changes.png
    :alt: Preview of the changes between the 2 hardware profiles
    :::

3. Select **Update** to apply the change.

::::{note}
If your deployment is configured for high availability, the hardware profile change does not impact your ability to read and write from the deployment as the change is rolled out instance by instance. Refer to [Plan for production](cloud-hosted.md) to learn about high availability (HA) and how to configure your deployment as HA.

## Change the hardware profile using the API [ec_change_the_hardware_profile_using_the_api]

Prerequisites:

* A valid Elastic Cloud [API key](../../api-keys/elastic-cloud-api-keys.md) (`$EC_API_KEY`)
* The deployment ID of the deployment you wish to modify (`{{deployment_id}}`)

Replace those values with your actual API key and deployment ID in the following instructions.

1. Get the current API payload for your deployment.

    ```sh
    curl \
    -H "Authorization: ApiKey $EC_API_KEY" \
    "https://api.elastic-cloud.com/api/v1/deployments/{deployment_id}"
    ```

2. Using the API payload for your deployment, determine the following:

    * Your current `deployment_template` ID. The template ID corresponds to the hardware profile used for your deployment.

        ```json
        "resources":{
              "elasticsearch":[
                 {
                    "ref_id":"main-elasticsearch",
                    "id":"$CLUSTER_ID",
                    "region":"gcp-us-central1",
                    "info":{
                       "cluster_id":"$CLUSTER_ID",
                       "cluster_name":"$CLUSTER_NAME",
                       "deployment_id":"$DEPLOYMENT_ID",
                       "plan_info":{
                          "current":{
                             "plan":{
                                "deployment_template":{
                                   "id":"gcp-cpu-optimized-v5"
                                },
        ```

    * The region that your deployment is in:

        ```json
        "resources":{
              "elasticsearch":[
                 {
                    "ref_id":"main-elasticsearch",
                    "id":"$DEPLOYMENT_ID",
                    "region":"gcp-us-central1",
        ```

3. Check the [hardware profiles available](asciidocalypse://docs/cloud/docs/reference/cloud/cloud-hosted/ec-regions-templates-instances.md) for the region that your deployment is in and find the template ID of the deployment hardware profile you’d like to use.

    ::::{tip}
    If you wish to update your hardware profile to the latest version available for that same profile, locate the template ID corresponding to the `deployment_template` you retrieved at step 2, but without the version information. For example, if your deployment’s current hardware profile is `gcp-cpu-optimized-v5`, use `gcp-cpu-optimized` as a template ID to update your deployment.
    ::::

4. Get the API payload for your deployment based on the new template ID.

    ```sh
    curl -XGET https://api.elastic-cloud.com/api/v1/deployments/{deployment_id}/migrate_template?template_id={new_template_id} \
    -H "Authorization: ApiKey $EC_API_KEY" > migrate_deployment.json
    ```

5. Use the payload returned to update your deployment to use the hardware profile.

    ```sh
    curl -XPUT https://api.elastic-cloud.com/api/v1/deployments/{deployment_id} \
    -H "Authorization: ApiKey $EC_API_KEY" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d @migrate_deployment.json
    ```



## List of hardware profiles [ec_list_of_hardware_profiles]
