# Manage deployments [ec-manage-deployment]

{{ech}} allows you to configure and maintain your deployments with a high level of control on every component of the {{stack}}. You can adjust the settings of any of your deployments at any time.

* Define the [core configuration](configure.md) of your deployment, including available features, hardware settings and capacity, autoscaling, and high availability.
* [Upgrade your deployment](/deploy-manage/upgrade/deployment-or-cluster.md) and its component to a newer version of the {{stack}}.
* Make adjustments to specific deployment components, such as an [Integrations Server](manage-integrations-server.md) or [APM & Fleet Server](switch-from-apm-to-integrations-server-payload.md#ec-manage-apm-and-fleet).
* [Keep track of your deployment's activity](keep-track-of-deployment-activity.md) or [Enable logging and monitoring](../../monitor/stack-monitoring/elastic-cloud-stack-monitoring.md) of the deployment performance.
* [Disable a data tier](../../../manage-data/lifecycle/index-lifecycle-management.md).
* Perform maintenance operations to ensure the health of your deployment, such as [restarting your deployment](../../maintenance/start-stop-services/restart-cloud-hosted-deployment.md), [stop routing](../../maintenance/ece/start-stop-routing-requests.md)
* [Delete your deployment](../../uninstall/delete-a-cloud-deployment.md).
