# Alternative: Install ECE with Ansible [ece-configure-ansible]

If you already use Ansible in your business for provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment, you can use the ECE Ansible playbook to get up and running with {{ece}} faster, on any cloud provider.

Elastic welcomes all community contributions to the repository and will validate any changes on a best-effort basis.
