# Alternative: Install ECE with Ansible [ece-configure-ansible]

If you already use Ansible in your business for provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment, you can use the ECE Ansible playbook to get up and running with Elastic Cloud Enterprise faster, on any cloud provider.

Please note that the ECE Ansible playbook is a community project, supported by Elastic, available on GitHub: [elastic/ansible-elastic-cloud-enterprise](https://github.com/elastic/ansible-elastic-cloud-enterprise). Elastic welcomes all community contributions to the repository and will validate any changes on a best-effort basis.
