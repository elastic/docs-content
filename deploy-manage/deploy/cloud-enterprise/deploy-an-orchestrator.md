% Scope notes: Introduction about the content of this big section (which covers install and configuration possibilities of the orchestrator)

Elastic Cloud Enterprise (ECE) provides a centralized platform that allows organizations to run **Elasticsearch, Kibana, and other Elastic Stack components** across multiple machines, whether in a private or public cloud, virtual machines, or your own premises.

If you need to manage multiple Elastic deployments across teams or geographies, you can leverage Elastic Cloud Enterprise to centralize cluster management for:
* Provisioning
* Monitoring
* Scaling
* Replication
* Upgrades
* Backup and restore

Centralizing the management of clusters with Elastic Cloud Enterprise enforces uniform versioning, data governance, backup, and user policies. Increased hardware utilization through better management can also reduce total cost.

This section covers the planning, installation, and configuration of ECE.
