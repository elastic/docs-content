% What needs to be done: Write from scratch

% GitHub issue: https://github.com/elastic/docs-projects/issues/339

% Scope notes: Introduction about the content of this big section (which covers install and configuration possibilities of the orchestrator)

Elastic Cloud Enterprise (ECE) provides a centralized platform that allows organizations to run **Elasticsearch, Kibana, and other Elastic Stack components** across multiple machines, whether in a private or public cloud, virtual machines, or your own premises.

This section provides step-by-step guidance on:

* [**Installing ECE**](./install.md) → Installation pre-requisites and multiple installation methods for all supported Operating Systems.
* [**Configuring ECE**](./configure.md) → (TBD)

If you're looking to deploy {{es}}, {{kib}} or other {{stack}} applications on ECE, refer to [](./working-with-deployments.md).
