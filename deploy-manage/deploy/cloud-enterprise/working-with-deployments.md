# Working with deployments

% What needs to be done: Refine

% GitHub issue: https://github.com/elastic/docs-projects/issues/339

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud-enterprise/ece-stack-getting-started.md
%      Notes: 9 child and sub-child docs (some of them are about "adding data to Elasticsearch" which might fit better somewhere else. we need to analyze that. We are missing https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-enterprise/current/ece-administering-deployments.html.... on purpose?
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud-enterprise/ece-administering-deployments.md
%      Notes: probably just a redirect
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud-enterprise/ece-change-deployment.md
%      Notes: another redirect
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud-enterprise/ece-monitoring-deployments.md
%      Notes: mostly redirect
