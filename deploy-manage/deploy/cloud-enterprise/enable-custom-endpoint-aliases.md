# Enable custom endpoint aliases [ece-configuring-deployment-aliases]

Custom endpoint aliases allow users to replace the UUID for each application with a human readable string. Platform administrators must enable this feature to allow deployment managers to create and modify aliases for their deployments.

::::{note}
You need to update your proxy certificates to support this feature.
::::


After installing or upgrading to version 2.10 or later:

1. [Login to the Cloud UI](log-into-cloud-ui.md)
2. [Update your proxy certificate(s)](../../security/secure-your-elastic-cloud-enterprise-installation/manage-security-certificates.md). In addition to currently configured domains, additional SAN entries must be configured for each application-specific subdomain:

    ::::{note}
    If you are not using wildcard certificates, you need to repeat this process for each deployment to account for specific aliases. Review [Wildcard DNS record and certificates](./ece-wildcard-dns.md) for more guidance.
    ::::
    

    * For {{es}}, the certificate needs to allow for **\*.es.<your-domain>**
    * For {{kib}}, the certificate needs to allow for **\*.kb.<your-domain>**
    * For APM, the certificate needs to allow for **\*.apm.<your-domain>**
    * For Fleet, the certificate needs to allow for **\*.fleet.<your-domain>**
    * For Universal Profiling, the certificate needs to allow for **\*.profiling.<your-domain>** and **\*.symbols.<your-domain>**

    ::::{note} 
    If you plan to deploy [Integration Servers](../../deploy/cloud-enterprise/manage-integrations-server.md), you must add two additional wildcard subdomains, `*.fleet.<your-domain>` and `*.apm.<your-domain>`, to the Subject Alternative Names (SANs) attached to the proxy wildcard certificate.
    ::::

3. In the **Platform** menu, select **Settings**.
4. Under the **Enable custom endpoint alias naming**, toggle the setting to allow platform administrators and deployment managers to choose a simplified, unique URL for the endpoint.
