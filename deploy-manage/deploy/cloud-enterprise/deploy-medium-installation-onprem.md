# Deploy a medium installation onprem [ece-install-medium-onprem]

This type of installation is recommended for many production setups. You need:

* 3 hosts with at least 32 GB RAM each for directors and coordinators (ECE management services), and proxies
* 3 hosts with 256 GB RAM each for allocators
* 3 availability zones

## Before you start [ece_before_you_start_5]

* Monitor the load on proxies and make sure the volume of user requests routed by the proxies does not affect the resources available to the ECE management services.
* Note that the medium-sized Elastic Cloud Enterprise installation separates the allocator from the director and coordinator roles (ECE management services) and the proxy roles.

**Check the recommended JVM Heap sizes**

| Service | JVM Heap Size (Xms and Xmx) |
| --- | --- |
| `runner` | 1 GB |
| `allocator` | 4 GB |
| `zookeeper` | 8 GB |
| `director` | 1 GB |
| `constructor` | 4 GB |
| `admin-console` | 8 GB |

::::{warning}
For production environments, you must define the memory settings for each role, except for the `proxy` role, as starting from ECE 2.4 the JVM proxy was replaced with a Golang-based proxy. If you donâ€™t set any memory setting, the default values are used, which are inadequate for production environments and can lead to performance or stability issues.

## Installation steps [ece_installation_steps_5]

1. Install Elastic Cloud Enterprise on the first host to start a new installation with your first availability zone. This first host holds all roles to help bootstrap the rest of the installation, but you will remove some of its roles in a later step.

    ```sh
    bash <(curl -fsSL https://download.elastic.co/cloud/elastic-cloud-enterprise.sh) install --availability-zone MY_ZONE-1 --memory-settings '{"runner":{"xms":"1G","xmx":"1G"},"allocator":{"xms":"4G","xmx":"4G"},"zookeeper":{"xms":"8G","xmx":"8G"},"director":{"xms":"1G","xmx":"1G"},"constructor":{"xms":"4G","xmx":"4G"},"admin-console":{"xms":"8G","xmx":"8G"}}'
    ```

    After the installation completes, copy down the coordinator host IP address, user credentials, and roles token information. Keep this information safe.

2. Generate a new roles token that persists for one hour on the first host, so that other hosts can join your installation with the right role permissions in the next step (referred to as `MY_TOKEN`). The new token needs to enable the director, coordinator and proxy roles.

    ```sh
    curl -k -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -u admin:PASSWORD https://localhost:12443/api/v1/platform/configuration/security/enrollment-tokens -d '{ "persistent": false, "roles": ["director", "coordinator", "proxy"] }'
    ```

3. Install Elastic Cloud Enterprise on a second and third host, placing them into a second and a third availability zone, and assign them the `director`, `coordinator`, and `proxy` roles. Do not assign the `allocator` role, as these hosts should not handle any user requests. Make sure you include the coordinator host IP information from step 1 and the new roles token from step 2.

    ```sh
    bash <(curl -fsSL https://download.elastic.co/cloud/elastic-cloud-enterprise.sh) install --coordinator-host HOST_IP --roles-token 'MY_TOKEN' --roles "director,coordinator,proxy" --availability-zone MY_ZONE-2 --memory-settings '{"runner":{"xms":"1G","xmx":"1G"},"zookeeper":{"xms":"8G","xmx":"8G"},"director":{"xms":"1G","xmx":"1G"},"constructor":{"xms":"4G","xmx":"4G"},"admin-console":{"xms":"8G","xmx":"8G"}}'
    ```

    ```sh
    bash <(curl -fsSL https://download.elastic.co/cloud/elastic-cloud-enterprise.sh) install --coordinator-host HOST_IP --roles-token 'MY_TOKEN' --roles "director,coordinator,proxy" --availability-zone MY_ZONE-3 --memory-settings '{"runner":{"xms":"1G","xmx":"1G"},"zookeeper":{"xms":"8G","xmx":"8G"},"director":{"xms":"1G","xmx":"1G"},"constructor":{"xms":"4G","xmx":"4G"},"admin-console":{"xms":"8G","xmx":"8G"}}'
    ```

4. To handle the Elasticsearch and Kibana workload, install Elastic Cloud Enterprise on a fourth, fifth, and sixth host, distributing them evenly across the existing three availability zones and assign them the `allocator` role. Make sure you include the coordinator host IP information and allocator roles token from step 1.

    ```sh
    bash <(curl -fsSL https://download.elastic.co/cloud/elastic-cloud-enterprise.sh) install --coordinator-host HOST_IP --roles-token 'ALLOCATOR_TOKEN' --roles "allocator" --availability-zone MY_ZONE-1 --memory-settings '{"runner":{"xms":"1G","xmx":"1G"},"allocator":{"xms":"4G","xmx":"4G"}}'

    bash <(curl -fsSL https://download.elastic.co/cloud/elastic-cloud-enterprise.sh) install --coordinator-host HOST_IP --roles-token 'ALLOCATOR_TOKEN' --roles "allocator" --availability-zone MY_ZONE-2 --memory-settings '{"runner":{"xms":"1G","xmx":"1G"},"allocator":{"xms":"4G","xmx":"4G"}}'

    bash <(curl -fsSL https://download.elastic.co/cloud/elastic-cloud-enterprise.sh) install --coordinator-host HOST_IP --roles-token 'ALLOCATOR_TOKEN' --roles "allocator" --availability-zone MY_ZONE-3 --memory-settings '{"runner":{"xms":"1G","xmx":"1G"},"allocator":{"xms":"4G","xmx":"4G"}}'
    ```
