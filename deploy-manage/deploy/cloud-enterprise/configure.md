# Configure [ece-configuring-ece]

Now that you have Elastic Cloud Enterprise up and running, take a look at some of the additional features that you can configure:

* [System deployment configuration](system-deployments-configuration.md) - Best practices for ECE system deployments to ensure a highly available and resilient setup.
* [Configure deployment templates](configure-deployment-templates.md) - Make the most out of deployment templates by configuring ECE for your hardware and creating custom deployment templates.
* [Manage snapshot repositories](../../tools/snapshot-and-restore/cloud-enterprise.md) - To back up your Elasticsearch clusters automatically, you need to configure a snapshot repository.
* [Manage licenses](../../license/manage-your-license-in-ece.md) - Keep Elastic Cloud Enterprise current with a valid license.
* [Change endpoint URLs](change-endpoint-urls.md) - Set where Elasticsearch and Kibana can be accessed from.
* [Configure allocator affinity](configure-allocator-affinity.md) - Determine how ECE distributes your Elastic Stack deployments across allocators.
* [Change allocator disconnect timeout](change-allocator-disconnect-timeout.md) - Configure how long ECE waits before considering allocators to be disconnected.
* [Migrate ECE on Podman hosts to SELinux in enforcing mode](migrate-ece-on-podman-hosts-to-selinux-enforce.md) - Migrate ECE to SELinux in `enforcing` mode using Podman.
