# Identify the deployment scenario [ece-deploy-scenario]

Before you start deploying ECE, choose the deployment scenario that best fits your use case. All deployment scenarios have 3 director nodes for [high availability](ece-ha.md).


## Small deployment [ece_small_deployment]

The type of deployment is recommended for development, test, and small-scale use cases. You need:

* 3 hosts with 128 GB RAM
* 3 availability zones

:::

* This type of installation is **not recommended for high-traffic workloads**.
* Avoid ECE installations with **spinning disks** as these are not supported when you run allocators and control plane on the same server.
* Note that the small-size ECE installation keeps the directors and coordinators roles (ECE management services) on the same hosts as your allocators and proxies.

You can proceed with this scenario and install ECE with [Ansible](alternative-install-ece-with-ansible.md), on a [public cloud](install-ece-on-public-cloud.md), or on [your own premises](install-ece-on-own-premises.md).


## Medium deployment [ece_medium_deployment]

This type of deployment is recommended for many production setups. You need:

* 3 hosts with at least 32 GB RAM each for directors and coordinators (ECE management services)
* 3 hosts for allocators, each with one of the following RAM configurations:

    * 1 x 256 GB RAM
    * 2 x 128 GB RAM
    * 4 x 64 GB RAM

* 3 hosts with 16 GB RAM each for proxies
* 3 availability zones

:alt: A medium installation with nine to twelve hosts across three availability zones
:::

* Monitor the load on proxies and make sure the volume of user requests routed by the proxies does not affect the resources available to the ECE management services.
* Note that the large-sized Elastic Cloud Enterprise installation separates the allocator and proxy roles from the director and coordinator roles (ECE management services).

You can proceed with this scenario and install ECE with [Ansible](alternative-install-ece-with-ansible.md), on a [public cloud](install-ece-on-public-cloud.md), or on [your own premises](install-ece-on-own-premises.md).


## Large deployment [ece_large_deployment]

This type of deployment is recommended for deployments with significant overall search and indexing throughput. You need:

* 3 hosts with at least 64 GB RAM each for directors and coordinators (ECE management services)
* 3 hosts for allocators, each with one of the following RAM configurations:

    * 1 x 256 GB RAM
    * 2 x 128 GB RAM
    * 4 x 64 GB RAM

* 3 hosts with 16 GB RAM each for proxies
* 3 availability zones

Note that the large-sized Elastic Cloud Enterprise installation separates the allocator and proxy roles from the director and coordinator roles (ECE management services).

You can proceed with this scenario and install ECE with [Ansible](alternative-install-ece-with-ansible.md), on a [public cloud](install-ece-on-public-cloud.md), or on [your own premises](install-ece-on-own-premises.md).
