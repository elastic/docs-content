# Log into the Cloud UI [ece-login]

To access the Cloud UI in a web browser:

1. Connect to one of the URLs provided at the end of the installation process on your first host, replacing `FIRST_HOST` with the correct IP address or DNS hostname.

    ```sh
    http://FIRST_HOST:12400
    https://FIRST_HOST:12443
    ```

    Secure access through the HTTPS protocol is available with certificates generated during the installation of Elastic Cloud Enterprise, but will prompt you with a warning in your browser. To avoid this warning, you can add [your own TLS/SSL security certificates](../../security/secure-your-elastic-cloud-enterprise-installation/manage-security-certificates.md). If you are on AWS and canâ€™t access the Cloud UI, [check if the URL points to a private IP address](../../../troubleshoot/deployments/cloud-enterprise/common-issues.md#ece-aws-private-ip).

2. Log in as user `admin` with the credentials provided.
3. On your first login, agree to the software license agreement to continue. You can opt out of sharing some basic usage statistics with Elastic. [Here is what we collect.](statistics-collected-by-cloud-enterprise.md)

The Cloud UI displays the available deployments and some important information about them. Three deployments are always shown:

* `admin-console-elasticsearch`: Backs the Cloud UI itself.
* `logging-and-metrics`: Collects logs and performance metrics for your ECE installation. You must not use this deployment to index monitoring data from your own Elasticsearch clusters or use it to index data from Beats and Logstash. Always create a separate, dedicated monitoring deployment for your own use.
* `security`: Stores all security-related configurations.
