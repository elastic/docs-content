# ECE installation procedures

Choose the guide for the {{ece}} [deployment scenario](/deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-enterprise/identify-deployment-scenario.md) that best fits your business needs:

* [Deploy a small installation](deploy-small-installation.md): For development, test, and small-scale use cases.
* [Deploy a medium installation](deploy-medium-installation.md): For many production setups.
* [Deploy a large installation](deploy-large-installation.md): For deployments with significant overall search and indexing throughput.

For installations using Podman instead of Docker, refer to [](./fresh-installation-of-ece-using-podman-hosts.md).

If you need to migrate an existing installation based on Docker to Podman, follow [](./migrate-ece-to-podman-hosts.md).
