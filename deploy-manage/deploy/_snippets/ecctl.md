{{ecloud}} Control (ECCTL) is the command-line interface for {{ecloud}} APIs. It wraps typical operations commonly needed by operators within a single command line tool.

ECCTL provides the following benefits: 

- Easier to use than the {{ecloud}} Console, Cloud UI, or using the RESTful API directly
- Helps you automate the deployment lifecycle
- Provides a foundation for integration with other tools
