::::{important}
Make sure to use a supported combination of Linux distribution and container engine version as defined in our official [Support matrix](https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix#elastic-cloud-enterprise). Unsupported combinations can lead to various issues in your ECE environment, including failures when creating system deployments, upgrading workload deployments, proxy timeouts, and more.

Note that FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) compliance is not officially supported in ECE. While ECE may function on FIPS-enabled systems, this configuration has not been validated through our testing processes and is not recommended for production environments.
