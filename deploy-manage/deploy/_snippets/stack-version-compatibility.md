When installing the {{stack}}, you must use the same version across the entire stack. For example, if you are using {{es}} {{version.stack}}, you install Beats {{version.stack}}, APM Server {{version.stack}}, {{es}} Hadoop {{version.stack}}, {{kib}} {{version.stack}}, and Logstash {{version.stack}}.

If youâ€™re upgrading an existing installation, see [](/deploy-manage/upgrade.md) for information about how to ensure compatibility with {{version.stack}}.
