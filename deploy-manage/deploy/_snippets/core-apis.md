- [{{es}} APIs](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/): This set of APIs allows you to interact directly with the {{es}} nodes in your deployment. You can ingest data, run search queries, check the health of your clusters, manage snapshots, and more.
- [{{kib}} APIs](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/kibana/): Many {{kib}} features can be accessed through these APIs, including {{kib}} objects, patterns, and dashboards, as well as user roles and user sessions. You can use these APIs to configure alerts and actions, and to access health details for the [{{kib}} Task Manager](/deploy-manage/distributed-architecture/kibana-tasks-management.md).
