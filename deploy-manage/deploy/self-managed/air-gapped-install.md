# Air gapped install

Some components of the {{stack}} require additional configuration and local dependencies in order to deploy in environments without internet access. This guide gives an overview of this setup scenario and connects you to existing documentation for individual parts of the stack.

Refer to the section for each Elastic component for air-gapped installation configuration and dependencies in a self-managed Linux environment.

## {{es}} [air-gapped-elasticsearch]

Air-gapped install of {{es}} may require additional steps in order to access some of the features. General install and configuration guides are available in [](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/installing-elasticsearch.md).

Specifically:

* To be able to use the GeoIP processor, refer to [the GeoIP processor documentation](elasticsearch://reference/enrich-processor/geoip-processor.md#manually-update-geoip-databases) for instructions on downloading and deploying the required databases.
* Refer to [{{ml-cap}}](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/air-gapped-install.md#air-gapped-machine-learning) for instructions on deploying the Elastic Learned Sparse EncodeR (ELSER) natural language processing (NLP) model and other trained {{ml}} models.


## {{kib}} [air-gapped-kibana]

Air-gapped install of {{kib}} may require a number of additional services in the local network in order to access some of the features. General install and configuration guides are available in the [{{kib}} install documentation](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/install-kibana.md).

Specifically:

* To be able to use {{kib}} mapping visualizations, you need to set up and configure the [Elastic Maps Service](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/air-gapped-install.md#air-gapped-elastic-maps-service).
* To be able to use {{kib}} sample data, install or update hundreds of prebuilt alert rules, and explore available data integrations, you need to set up and configure the [{{package-registry}}](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/air-gapped-install.md#air-gapped-elastic-package-registry).
* To provide detection rule updates for {{endpoint-sec}} agents, you need to set up and configure the [Elastic Endpoint Artifact Repository](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/air-gapped-install.md#air-gapped-elastic-endpoint-artifact-repository).
* To access the APM integration, you need to set up and configure [Elastic APM](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/air-gapped-install.md#air-gapped-elastic-apm).
* To install and use the Elastic documentation for {{kib}} AI assistants, you need to set up and configure the [Elastic product documentation for {{kib}}](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/air-gapped-install.md#air-gapped-kibana-product-documentation).


## {{beats}} [air-gapped-beats]

Elastic {{beats}} are light-weight data shippers. They do not require any special configuration in air-gapped environments. To learn more, refer to the [{{beats}} documentation](beats://reference/index.md).


## {{ls}} [air-gapped-logstash]

{{ls}} is a versatile data shipping and processing application. It does not require any special configuration in air-gapped environments. To learn more, refer to the [{{ls}} documentation](logstash://reference/index.md).


## {{agent}} [air-gapped-elastic-agent]

Air-gapped install of {{agent}} depends on the [{{package-registry}}](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/air-gapped-install.md#air-gapped-elastic-package-registry) and the [{{artifact-registry}}](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/air-gapped-install.md#air-gapped-elastic-artifact-registry) for most use-cases. The agent itself is fairly lightweight and installs dependencies only as required by its configuration. In terms of connections to these dependencies, {{agents}} need to be able to connect to the {{artifact-registry}} directly, but {{package-registry}} connections are handled through [{{kib}}](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/air-gapped-install.md#air-gapped-kibana).

Additionally, if the {{agent}} {{elastic-defend}} integration is used, then access to the [Elastic Endpoint Artifact Repository](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/air-gapped-install.md#air-gapped-elastic-endpoint-artifact-repository) is necessary in order to deploy updates for some of the detection and prevention capabilities.

To learn more about install and configuration, refer to the [{{agent}} install documentation](/reference/fleet/install-elastic-agents.md). Make sure to check the requirements specific to running {{agents}} in an [air-gapped environment](/reference/fleet/air-gapped.md).


## {{fleet-server}} [air-gapped-fleet]

{{fleet-server}} is a required middleware component for any scalable deployment of the {{agent}}. The air-gapped dependencies of {{fleet-server}} are the same as those of the [{{agent}}](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/air-gapped-install.md#air-gapped-elastic-agent).

To learn more about installing {{fleet-server}}, refer to the [{{fleet-server}} set up documentation](/reference/fleet/fleet-server.md).


## Elastic APM [air-gapped-elastic-apm]

Air-gapped setup of the APM server is possible in two ways:

* By setting up one of the {{agent}} deployments with an APM integration, as described in [Switch a self-installation to the APM integration](/solutions/observability/apm/switch-self-installation-to-apm-integration.md). See [air gapped installation guidance for {{agent}}](#air-gapped-elastic-agent).
* Or, by installing a standalone Elastic APM Server, as described in the [APM configuration documentation](/solutions/observability/apm/configure-apm-server.md).


## {{ems}} [air-gapped-elastic-maps-service]

Refer to [Connect to {{ems}}](../../../explore-analyze/visualize/maps/maps-connect-to-ems.md) in the {{kib}} documentation to learn how to configure your firewall to connect to {{ems}}, host it locally, or disable it completely.


## {{package-registry}} [air-gapped-elastic-package-registry]

Air-gapped install of the EPR is possible using any OCI-compatible runtime like Podman (a typical choice for RHEL-like Linux systems) or Docker. Links to the official container image and usage guide is available on the [Air-gapped environments](/reference/fleet/air-gapped.md) page in the {{fleet}} and {{agent}} Guide.

::::{note}
Besides setting up the EPR service, you also need to [configure {{kib}}](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/air-gapped-install.md#air-gapped-kibana) to use this service. If using TLS with the EPR service, it is also necessary to set up {{kib}} to trust the certificate presented by the EPR.

## {{artifact-registry}} [air-gapped-elastic-artifact-registry]

Air-gapped install of the {{artifact-registry}} is necessary in order to enable {{agent}} deployments to perform self-upgrades and install certain components which are needed for some of the data integrations (that is, in addition to what is also retrieved from the EPR). To learn more, refer to [Host your own artifact registry for binary downloads](/reference/fleet/air-gapped.md#host-artifact-registry) in the {{fleet}} and {{elastic-agent}} Guide.

::::{note}
When setting up own web server, such as NGINX, to function as the {{artifact-registry}}, it is recommended not to use TLS as there are, currently, no direct ways to establish certificate trust between {{agents}} and this service.

## Elastic Endpoint Artifact Repository [air-gapped-elastic-endpoint-artifact-repository]

Air-gapped setup of this component is, essentially, identical to the setup of the [{{artifact-registry}}](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/air-gapped-install.md#air-gapped-elastic-artifact-registry) except that different artifacts are served. To learn more, refer to [Configure offline endpoints and air-gapped environments](../../../solutions/security/configure-elastic-defend/configure-offline-endpoints-air-gapped-environments.md) in the Elastic Security guide.


## {{ml-cap}} [air-gapped-machine-learning]

Some {{ml}} features, like natural language processing (NLP), require you to deploy trained models. To learn about deploying {{ml}} models in an air-gapped environment, refer to:

* [Deploy ELSER in an air-gapped environment](../../../explore-analyze/machine-learning/nlp/ml-nlp-elser.md#air-gapped-install).
* [Install trained models in an air-gapped environment with Eland](eland://reference/machine-learning.md#ml-nlp-pytorch-air-gapped).
