# Plugins [modules-plugins]

Plugins are a way to enhance the basic Elasticsearch functionality in a custom manner. They range from adding custom mapping types, custom analyzers (in a more built in fashion), custom script engines, custom discovery and more.

For information about selecting and installing plugins, see [{{es}} Plugins and Integrations](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/current/index.html).

For information about developing your own plugin, see [Help for plugin authors](asciidocalypse://docs/elasticsearch/docs/extend/create-elasticsearch-plugins/index.md).
