# Install {{es}} with RPM [rpm]

The RPM package for {{es}} can be [downloaded from our website](#install-rpm) or from our  [RPM repository](#rpm-repo). It can be used to install {{es}} on any RPM-based system such as OpenSuSE, SLES, Centos, Red Hat, and Oracle Enterprise.

::::{note}
RPM install is not supported on distributions with old versions of RPM, such as SLES 11 and CentOS 5. Refer to [Install {{es}} from archive on Linux or MacOS](install-elasticsearch-from-archive-on-linux-macos.md) instead.

## Before you start

:::{include} _snippets/prereqs.md
:::

## Step 1: Import the {{es}} PGP key [rpm-key]

:::{include} _snippets/pgp-key.md
:::

```sh
rpm --import https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
```

## Step 2: Install {{es}}

You have several options for installing the {{es}} RPM package:

* [From the RPM repository](#rpm-repo)
* [Manually](#install-rpm)

### Install from the RPM repository [rpm-repo]

Create a file called `elasticsearch.repo` in the `/etc/yum.repos.d/` directory for RedHat based distributions, or in the `/etc/zypp/repos.d/` directory for OpenSuSE based distributions, containing:

```ini subs=true
[elasticsearch]
name={{es}} repository for 9.x packages
baseurl=https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/9.x/yum
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
enabled=0
autorefresh=1
type=rpm-md
```
And your repository is ready for use. You can now install {{es}} with one of the following commands:

```sh
sudo yum install --enablerepo=elasticsearch elasticsearch <1>
sudo dnf install --enablerepo=elasticsearch elasticsearch <2>
sudo zypper modifyrepo --enable elasticsearch && \
  sudo zypper install elasticsearch; \
  sudo zypper modifyrepo --disable elasticsearch <3>
```

1. Use `yum` on CentOS and older Red Hat based distributions.
2. Use `dnf` on Fedora and other newer Red Hat distributions.
3. Use `zypper` on OpenSUSE based distributions.

### Download and install the RPM manually [install-rpm]

1. Download and install the RPM for {{es}} {{version.stack}} with the following commands:

    ```sh subs=true
    wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-{{version.stack}}-x86_64.rpm
    wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-{{version.stack}}-x86_64.rpm.sha512
    shasum -a 512 -c elasticsearch-{{version.stack}}-x86_64.rpm.sha512 <1>
    sudo rpm --install elasticsearch-{{version.stack}}-x86_64.rpm
    ```

    1. Compares the SHA of the downloaded RPM and the published checksum, which should output `elasticsearch-<version>-x86_64.rpm: OK`.

    :::

2. Copy the terminal output from the install command to a local file. In particular, youâ€™ll need the password for the built-in `elastic` superuser account. The output also contains the commands to enable {{es}} to [run as a service](#running-systemd).

## Step 3: Set up the node for connectivity

:::{include} _snippets/node-connectivity.md
:::

### Set up a node as the first node in a cluster [first-node]

:::{include} _snippets/first-node.md
:::

### Reconfigure a node to join an existing cluster [existing-cluster]

:::{include} _snippets/join-existing-cluster.md
:::

## Step 4: Enable automatic creation of system indices [rpm-enable-indices]

:::{include} _snippets/enable-auto-indices.md
:::

## Step 5: Run {{es}} with `systemd` [running-systemd]

:::{include} _snippets/systemd.md
:::

### Start {{es}} automatically

:::{include} _snippets/systemd-startup.md
:::

### Log to the systemd journal

:::{include} _snippets/systemd-journal.md
:::

:::{include} _snippets/systemd-startup-timeout.md
:::

### Security at startup [deb-security-configuration]

:::{include} _snippets/auto-security-config-rpm-deb.md
:::

## Step 6: Reset the `elastic` superuser password

:::{include} _snippets/reset-superuser-rpm-deb.md
:::

:::{include} _snippets/pw-env-var.md
:::

## Step 7: Check that {{es}} is running [rpm-check-running]

:::{include} _snippets/check-es-running.md
:::

## Step 8 (Multi-node clusters only): Update the config files [update-config-files]

If you are deploying a multi-node cluster, then the `elasticsearch-reconfigure-node` tool adds all existing nodes to each newly enrolled node's `discovery.seed_hosts` setting. However, you need to go back to all of the nodes in the cluster and edit them so each node in the cluster can restart and rejoin the cluster as expected.

:::{note}
Because the initial node in the cluster is bootstrapped as a single-node cluster, it won't have `discovery.seed_hosts` configured. This setting is mandatory for multi-node clusters and must be added manually to the first node.

## Connect clients to {{es}} [_connect_clients_to_es_4]

### Use the CA fingerprint [_use_the_ca_fingerprint_2]

## Directory layout of RPM [rpm-layout]

The RPM places config files, logs, and the data directory in the appropriate locations for an RPM-based system:

| Type | Description | Default Location | Setting |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| home |{{es}} home directory or `$ES_HOME` | `/usr/share/elasticsearch` |  |
| bin | Binary scripts including `elasticsearch` to start a node    and `elasticsearch-plugin` to install plugins | `/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin` |  |
| conf | Configuration files including `elasticsearch.yml` | `/etc/elasticsearch` | [`ES_PATH_CONF`](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#config-files-location) |
| conf | Environment variables including heap size, file descriptors. | `/etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch` |  |
| conf | Generated TLS keys and certificates for the transport and http layer. | `/etc/elasticsearch/certs` |  |
| data | The location of the data files of each index / shard allocated    on the node. | `/var/lib/elasticsearch` | [`path.data`](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/important-settings-configuration.md#path-settings) |
| jdk | The bundled Java Development Kit used to run {{es}}. Can    be overridden by setting the `ES_JAVA_HOME` environment variable    in `/etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch`. | `/usr/share/elasticsearch/jdk` |  |
| logs | Log files location. | `/var/log/elasticsearch` | [`path.logs`](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/important-settings-configuration.md#path-settings) |
| plugins | Plugin files location. Each plugin will be contained in a subdirectory. | `/usr/share/elasticsearch/plugins` |  |
| repo | Shared file system repository locations. Can hold multiple locations. A file system repository can be placed in to any subdirectory of any directory specified here. | Not configured | [`path.repo`](/deploy-manage/tools/snapshot-and-restore/shared-file-system-repository.md) |
