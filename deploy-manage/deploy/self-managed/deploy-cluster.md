# Deploy the cluster

% What needs to be done: Refine

% GitHub issue: https://github.com/elastic/docs-projects/issues/340

% Scope notes: Work with the previous content to explain the different options to install Elasticsearch and Kibana, remove the references to cloud based installation. cover ES + kibana - install of other stack components should be taken care of in that content set hints about install order (First ES then Kib). Add an introduction also to the installation methods (locally, production, multiple OSs).
