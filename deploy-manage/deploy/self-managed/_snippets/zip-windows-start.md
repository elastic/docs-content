Run the following command to start {{es}} from the command line:

```sh
.\bin\elasticsearch.bat
```

By default {{es}} prints its logs to the console (`STDOUT`) and to the `<cluster name>.log` file within the [logs directory](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/important-settings-configuration.md#path-settings). {{es}} logs some information while it is starting, but after it has finished initializing it will continue to run in the foreground and wonâ€™t log anything further until something happens that is worth recording. While {{es}} is running you can interact with it through its HTTP interface which is on port `9200` by default.

To stop {{es}}, press `Ctrl-C`.
