If your enrollment token has expired, then you can generate a new enrollment token for {{kib}} with the [`elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token`](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/command-line-tools/create-enrollment-token.md) tool:

```sh
bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s kibana
```
