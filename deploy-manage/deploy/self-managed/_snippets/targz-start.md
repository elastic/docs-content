Run the following command to start {{es}} from the command line:

```sh
./bin/elasticsearch
```
By default, {{es}} prints its logs to the console (`stdout`) and to the `<cluster name>.log` file within the [logs directory](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/important-settings-configuration.md#path-settings). {{es}} logs some information while it is starting, but after it has finished initializing it will continue to run in the foreground and wonâ€™t log anything further until something happens that is worth recording. While {{es}} is running you can interact with it through its HTTP interface which is on port `9200` by default.

To stop {{es}}, press `Ctrl-C`.

::::{note}
All scripts packaged with {{es}} require a version of Bash that supports arrays and assume that Bash is available at `/bin/bash`. As such, Bash should be available at this path either directly or via a symbolic link.
