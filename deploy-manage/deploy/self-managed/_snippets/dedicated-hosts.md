In production, we recommend you run {{es}} on a dedicated host or as a primary service. Several {{es}} features, such as automatic JVM heap sizing, assume that {{es}} is the only resource-intensive application on the host or container. For example, you might run {{metricbeat}} alongside {{es}} for cluster statistics, but a resource-heavy {{ls}} deployment should be on its own host.
