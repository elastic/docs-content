To enroll new nodes in your cluster, create an enrollment token with the [`elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token`](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/command-line-tools/create-enrollment-token.md) tool on any existing node in your cluster. You can then start a new node with the `--enrollment-token` parameter so that it joins an existing cluster.

:::{tip}
Before you enroll your new node, make sure that it is able to access the first node in your cluster. You can test this by running a `curl` command to the first node. 

If you can't access the first node, then modify your network configuration before proceeding.
:::

1. Using a text editor, update the `cluster.name` in [`elasticsearch.yml`](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md) to match the other nodes in your cluster. 
   
   :::{note}
   If this value isn't updated and you attempt to join an existing cluster, then the connection will fail with the following error:

   ```text
   handshake failed: remote cluster name [cluster-to-join] does not match local cluster name [current-cluster-name]
   ```
   :::

2. In a separate terminal from where {{es}} is running, navigate to the directory where you installed {{es}} and run the `elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token` tool to generate an enrollment token for your new nodes.

    ```sh subs=true
    .{{slash}}bin{{slash}}elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s node
    ```

    Copy the enrollment token, which youâ€™ll use to enroll new nodes with your {{es}} cluster.

    An enrollment token has a lifespan of 30 minutes. You should create a new enrollment token for each new node that you add.

3. From the installation directory of your new node, start {{es}} and pass the enrollment token with the `--enrollment-token` parameter.

    ```sh subs=true
    .{{slash}}bin{{slash}}elasticsearch --enrollment-token <enrollment-token>
    ```

    {{es}} automatically generates certificates and keys in the following directory:

    ```sh subs=true
    config{{slash}}certs
    ```

You can repeat these steps for each additional {{es}} node that you would like to add to the cluster.
