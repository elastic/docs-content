# Installing Elasticsearch

% What needs to be done: Refine

% GitHub issue: https://github.com/elastic/docs-projects/issues/340

% Scope notes: From the initial doc remove the reference to cloud based and the title self-managed, as this is already self-managed. We have to merge and decide the final content considering the first two documents. The one with "security" in the name doesn't really differ from the first one, as now security is enabled by default, so it's not needed anymore, but it has interesting details that might be needed on the legacy installation docs. The third doc (tutorial style) can be omitted, we leave it here for redirection purposes only.

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/install-elasticsearch.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/configuring-stack-security.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/stack-docs/elastic-stack/installing-stack-demo-self.md
