# Configure {{es}} [settings]

{{es}} ships with good defaults and requires very little configuration. Most settings can be changed on a running cluster using the [Cluster update settings](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-cluster-put-settings) API.

The configuration files should contain settings which are node-specific (such as `node.name` and paths), or settings which a node requires in order to be able to join a cluster, such as `cluster.name` and `network.host`.

:::{note}
This topic describes how to configure a self-managed {{es}} cluster. Other deployment types must be configured using different steps.

To learn how to configure `elasticsearch.yml` for other deployment types, refer to [](/deploy-manage/stack-settings.md).

JVM and log4j configuration is not available in all deployment types. To learn how to configure limited JVM options in {{eck}}, refer to [](/deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-on-k8s/manage-compute-resources.md).

## Available settings

For a complete list of settings that you can apply to your {{es}} cluster, refer to the [{{es}} configuration reference](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/configuration-reference/index.md).

For a list of settings that must be configured before using your cluster in production, refer to [](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/important-settings-configuration.md).


## Config files [config-files-location] 

{{es}} has three configuration files:

* `elasticsearch.yml` for configuring {{es}}
* `jvm.options` for configuring {{es}} [JVM settings](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/jvm-settings.md)
* `log4j2.properties` for configuring [{{es}} logging](/deploy-manage/monitor/logging-configuration/elasticsearch-log4j-configuration-self-managed.md)

These files are located in the config directory, whose default location depends on whether the installation is from an archive distribution (`tar.gz` or `zip`) or a package distribution (Debian or RPM packages).

### Archive distributions

For the archive distributions, the config directory location defaults to `$ES_HOME/config`. The location of the config directory can be changed using the `ES_PATH_CONF` environment variable:

```sh
ES_PATH_CONF=/path/to/my/config ./bin/elasticsearch
```

Alternatively, you can `export` the `ES_PATH_CONF` environment variable through the command line or through your shell profile.

### Package distributions

For the package distributions, the config directory location defaults to `/etc/elasticsearch`. 

The location of the config directory can be changed by setting the `ES_PATH_CONF` environment variable, however, setting the environment variable in your shell is not sufficient. Instead, this variable is sourced from one the following locations:

* Debian: `/etc/default/elasticsearch` 
* RPM: `/etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch` 

You need to edit the `ES_PATH_CONF=/etc/elasticsearch` entry in the relevant file for your package to change the config directory location.

## Cluster and node setting types [cluster-setting-types] 

Cluster and node settings can be categorized based on how they are configured:

### Dynamic [dynamic-cluster-setting]

### Static [static-cluster-setting]
