# Bootstrap Checks

% What needs to be done: Refine

% GitHub issue: https://github.com/elastic/docs-projects/issues/340

% Scope notes: This page shows Development vs Production modes. Very useful and needed during the installation. Should we put the child docs in REFERENCE material -> Elasticsearch Bootstrap Checks reference?

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/bootstrap-checks.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/bootstrap-checks-xpack.md
%      Notes: FYI Colleen McGinnis removed "All children" because the linked page has no children

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$dev-vs-prod-mode$$$

$$$bootstrap-checks-tls$$$

$$$single-node-discovery$$$
