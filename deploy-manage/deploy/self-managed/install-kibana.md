# Install {{kib}}

This section includes information on how to setup {{kib}} and get it running, including:


* Downloading
* Installing
* Starting
* Configuring
* Upgrading


## Supported platforms [supported-platforms] 

Packages of {{kib}} are provided for and tested against Linux, Darwin, and Windows. Since {{kib}} runs on Node.js, we include the necessary Node.js binaries for these platforms. Running {{kib}} against a separately maintained version of Node.js is not supported.

To support certain older Linux platforms (most notably CentOS7/RHEL7), {{kib}} for Linux ships with a custom build of Node.js with glibc 2.17 support. For details, see [Custom builds of Node.js](asciidocalypse://docs/kibana/docs/extend/upgrading-nodejs.md#custom-nodejs-builds).

## {{kib}} install packages [install]

{{kib}} is provided in the following package formats:

`tar.gz`/`zip`
:   The `tar.gz` packages are provided for installation on Linux and Darwin and are the easiest choice for getting started with {{kib}}.

    The `zip` package is the only supported package for Windows.

    [Install from archive on Linux or macOS](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/install-from-archive-on-linux-macos.md) or [Install on Windows](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/install-on-windows.md)


`deb`
:   The `deb` package is suitable for Debian, Ubuntu, and other Debian-based systems.  Debian packages may be downloaded from the Elastic website or from our Debian repository.

    [Install with Debian package](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/install-with-debian-package.md)


`rpm`
:   The `rpm` package is suitable for installation on Red Hat, SLES, OpenSuSE and other RPM-based systems.  RPMs may be downloaded from the Elastic website or from our RPM repository.

    [Install with RPM](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/install-with-rpm.md)


`docker`
:   Images are available for running {{kib}} as a Docker container. They may be downloaded from the Elastic Docker Registry.

::::{important} 
If your {{es}} installation is protected by [{{stack-security-features}}](/deploy-manage/security.md) see [Configuring security in {{kib}}](/deploy-manage/security.md) for additional setup instructions.

## {{es}} version [elasticsearch-version] 

{{kib}} should be configured to run against an {{es}} node of the same version. This is the officially supported configuration.

Running different major version releases of {{kib}} and {{es}} (e.g. {{kib}} 9.x and {{es}} 8.x) is not supported, nor is running a minor version of {{kib}} that is newer than the version of {{es}} (e.g. {{kib}} 8.14 and {{es}} 8.13).

Running a minor version of {{es}} that is higher than {{kib}} will generally work in order to facilitate an upgrade process where {{es}} is upgraded first (e.g. {{kib}} 8.14 and {{es}} 8.15). In this configuration, a warning will be logged on {{kib}} server startup, so itâ€™s only meant to be temporary until {{kib}} is upgraded to the same version as {{es}}.

Running different patch version releases of {{kib}} and {{es}} (e.g. {{kib}} 9.0.0 and {{es}} 9.0.1) is generally supported, though we encourage users to run the same versions of {{kib}} and {{es}} down to the patch version.
