# Install Kibana

% What needs to be done: Refine

% GitHub issue: https://github.com/elastic/docs-projects/issues/340

% Scope notes: Good intro / landing page. Merge the content of both, and remove the reference to cloud

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/kibana/kibana/setup.md
%      Notes: 5 child docs, all needed
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/kibana/kibana/install.md

⚠️ **This page is a work in progress.** ⚠️

The documentation team is working to combine content pulled from the following pages:

* [/raw-migrated-files/kibana/kibana/setup.md](/raw-migrated-files/kibana/kibana/setup.md)
* [/raw-migrated-files/kibana/kibana/install.md](/raw-migrated-files/kibana/kibana/install.md)
