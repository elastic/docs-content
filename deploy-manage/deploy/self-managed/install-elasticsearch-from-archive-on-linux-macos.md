# Install {{es}} from archive on Linux or MacOS [targz]

{{es}} is available as a `.tar.gz` archive for Linux and MacOS.

:::{include} _snippets/trial.md
:::

:::{include} _snippets/es-releases.md
:::

:::{include} _snippets/java-version.md
:::

## Before you start

:::{include} _snippets/prereqs.md
:::

## Step 1: Download and install the archive

Download and install the archive for Linux or MacOS.

### Linux [install-linux]

The Linux archive for {{es}} {{stack-version}} can be downloaded and installed as follows:

```sh subs=true
wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-{{stack-version}}-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-{{stack-version}}-linux-x86_64.tar.gz.sha512
shasum -a 512 -c elasticsearch-{{stack-version}}-linux-x86_64.tar.gz.sha512 <1>
tar -xzf elasticsearch-{{stack-version}}-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
cd elasticsearch-{{stack-version}}/ <2>
```

1. Compares the SHA of the downloaded `.tar.gz` archive and the published checksum, which should output `elasticsearch-<version>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz: OK`.
2. This directory is known as `$ES_HOME`.



### MacOS [install-macos]

The MacOS archive for {{es}} {{stack-version}} can be downloaded and installed as follows:

```sh subs=true
curl -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-{{stack-version}}-darwin-x86_64.tar.gz
curl https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-{{stack-version}}-darwin-x86_64.tar.gz.sha512 | shasum -a 512 -c - <1>
tar -xzf elasticsearch-{{stack-version}}-darwin-x86_64.tar.gz
cd elasticsearch-{{stack-version}}/ <2>
```

1. Compares the SHA of the downloaded `.tar.gz` archive and the published checksum, which should output `elasticsearch-<version>-darwin-x86_64.tar.gz: OK`.
2. This directory is known as `$ES_HOME`.

::::{admonition} macOS Gatekeeper warnings
:class: important

Apple’s rollout of stricter notarization requirements affected the notarization of the {{stack-version}} {{es}} artifacts. If macOS displays a dialog when you first run {{es}} that interrupts it, then you need to take an action to allow it to run.

To prevent Gatekeeper checks on the {{es}} files, run the following command on the downloaded .tar.gz archive or the directory to which was extracted:

```sh
xattr -d -r com.apple.quarantine <archive-or-directory>
```

Alternatively, you can add a security override by following the instructions in the *If you want to open an app that hasn’t been notarized or is from an unidentified developer* section of [Safely open apps on your Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491).

## Step 2: Enable automatic creation of system indices [targz-enable-indices]

:::{include} _snippets/enable-auto-indices.md
:::

## Step 3: Start {{es}} [targz-running]

You have several options for starting {{es}}:

* [Run from the command line](#command-line)
* [Run the node to be enrolled in an existing cluster](#existing-cluster)
* [Run as a daemon](#setup-installation-daemon)

### Run {{es}} from the command line [command-line]

#### Configure {{es}} on the command line [targz-configuring]

:::{include} _snippets/cmd-line-config.md
:::

### Enroll the node in an existing cluster [existing-cluster]

:::{include} _snippets/enroll-nodes.md
:::

### Run as a daemon [setup-installation-daemon]

:::{include} _snippets/targz-daemon.md

## Step 4: Check that {{es}} is running [check_that_elasticsearch_is_running]

:::{include} _snippets/check-es-running.md

## Connect clients to {{es}} [connect_clients_to_es]

:::{include} _snippets/connect-clients.md

### Use the CA fingerprint [use_the_ca_fingerprint]

:::{include} _snippets/ca-fingerprint.md

## Directory layout of archives [targz-layout]

The archive distributions are entirely self-contained. All files and directories are, by default, contained within `$ES_HOME` — the directory created when unpacking the archive.

This is convenient because you don’t have to create any directories to start using {{es}}, and uninstalling {{es}} is as easy as removing the `$ES_HOME` directory. However, you should change the default locations of the config directory, the data directory, and the logs directory so that you do not delete important data later on.

| Type | Description | Default location | Setting |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| home | {{es}} home directory or `$ES_HOME` | Directory created by unpacking the archive |  |
| bin | Binary scripts including `elasticsearch` to start a node    and `elasticsearch-plugin` to install plugins | `$ES_HOME/bin` |  |
| conf | Configuration files, including `elasticsearch.yml` | `$ES_HOME/config` | [`ES_PATH_CONF`](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#config-files-location) |
| conf | Generated TLS keys and certificates for the transport and HTTP layer. | `$ES_HOME/config/certs` |  |
| data | The location of the data files of each index / shard allocated    on the node. | `$ES_HOME/data` | [`path.data`](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/important-settings-configuration.md#path-settings) |
| logs | Log files location. | `$ES_HOME/logs` | [`path.logs`](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/important-settings-configuration.md#path-settings) |
| plugins | Plugin files location. Each plugin will be contained in a subdirectory. | `$ES_HOME/plugins` |  |
| repo | Shared file system repository locations. Can hold multiple locations. A file system repository can be placed in to any subdirectory of any directory specified here. | Not configured | [`path.repo`](/deploy-manage/tools/snapshot-and-restore/shared-file-system-repository.md) |
