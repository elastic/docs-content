# Install {{es}} from archive on Linux or MacOS [targz]

{{es}} is available as a `.tar.gz` archive for Linux and MacOS.

:::{include} _snippets/trial.md
:::

:::{include} _snippets/es-releases.md
:::

:::{include} _snippets/java-version.md
:::

:::{tip}
Elastic recommends that you run the commands in this guide using a normal user account, and avoid running the commands as `root`.

## Before you start

:::{include} _snippets/prereqs.md
:::

## Step 1: Download and install the archive

Download and install the archive for Linux or MacOS.

### Linux [install-linux]

The Linux archive for {{es}} {{version.stack}} can be downloaded and installed as follows:

```sh subs=true
wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-{{version.stack}}-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-{{version.stack}}-linux-x86_64.tar.gz.sha512
shasum -a 512 -c elasticsearch-{{version.stack}}-linux-x86_64.tar.gz.sha512 <1>
tar -xzf elasticsearch-{{version.stack}}-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
cd elasticsearch-{{version.stack}}/ <2>
```

1. Compares the SHA of the downloaded `.tar.gz` archive and the published checksum, which should output `elasticsearch-<version>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz: OK`.
2. This directory is known as `$ES_HOME`.



### MacOS [install-macos]

The MacOS archive for {{es}} {{version.stack}} can be downloaded and installed as follows:

```sh subs=true
curl -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-{{version.stack}}-darwin-x86_64.tar.gz
curl https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-{{version.stack}}-darwin-x86_64.tar.gz.sha512 | shasum -a 512 -c - <1>
tar -xzf elasticsearch-{{version.stack}}-darwin-x86_64.tar.gz
cd elasticsearch-{{version.stack}}/ <2>
```

1. Compares the SHA of the downloaded `.tar.gz` archive and the published checksum, which should output `elasticsearch-<version>-darwin-x86_64.tar.gz: OK`.
2. This directory is known as `$ES_HOME`.

::::{admonition} macOS Gatekeeper warnings
:class: important

Apple’s rollout of stricter notarization requirements affected the notarization of the {{version.stack}} {{es}} artifacts. If macOS displays a dialog when you first run {{es}} that interrupts it, then you need to take an action to allow it to run.

To prevent Gatekeeper checks on the {{es}} files, run the following command on the downloaded .tar.gz archive or the directory to which was extracted:

```sh
xattr -d -r com.apple.quarantine <archive-or-directory>
```

Alternatively, you can add a security override by following the instructions in the *If you want to open an app that hasn’t been notarized or is from an unidentified developer* section of [Safely open apps on your Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491).

## Step 2: Enable automatic creation of system indices [targz-enable-indices]

:::{include} _snippets/enable-auto-indices.md
:::


## Step 3: Set up the node for connectivity

:::{include} _snippets/cluster-formation-brief.md
:::

* If you're installing the first node in a multi-node cluster across multiple hosts, then you need to [configure the node so that other hosts are able to connect to it](#first-node).

* If you're installing additional nodes for a cluster, then you need to [generate an enrollment token and pass it when starting {{es}} for the first time](#existing-cluster).

### Set up a node as the first node in a multi-host cluster [first-node]

:::{include} _snippets/first-node.md
:::

### Enroll the node in an existing cluster [existing-cluster]

:::{include} _snippets/enroll-nodes.md
:::

## Step 4: Start {{es}} [targz-running]

You have several options for starting {{es}}:

* [Run from the command line](#command-line)
* [Run as a daemon](#setup-installation-daemon)

If you're starting a node that will be enrolled in an existing cluster, refer to [Enroll the node in an existing cluster](#existing-cluster).

### Run {{es}} from the command line [command-line]

:::{include} _snippets/targz-start.md
:::

#### Security at startup [security-at-startup]

:::{include} _snippets/auto-security-config.md
:::

The password for the `elastic` user and the enrollment token for {{kib}} are output to your terminal.

:::{include} _snippets/pw-env-var.md
:::

#### Configure {{es}} on the command line [targz-configuring]

:::{include} _snippets/cmd-line-config.md
:::

### Run as a daemon [setup-installation-daemon]

:::{include} _snippets/targz-daemon.md
:::

## Step 4: Check that {{es}} is running [check_that_elasticsearch_is_running]

:::{include} _snippets/check-es-running.md
:::

## Step 5 (Multi-node clusters only): Update the config files [update-config-files]

If you are deploying a multi-node cluster, then the enrollment process adds all existing nodes to each newly enrolled node's `discovery.seed_hosts` setting. However, you need to go back to all of the nodes in the cluster and edit them so each node in the cluster can restart and rejoin the cluster as expected.

:::{note}
Because the initial node in the cluster is bootstrapped as a single-node cluster, it won't have `discovery.seed_hosts` configured. This setting is mandatory for multi-node clusters and must be added manually to the first node.

### Use the CA fingerprint [use_the_ca_fingerprint]

## Directory layout of archives [targz-layout]

The archive distributions are entirely self-contained. All files and directories are, by default, contained within `$ES_HOME` — the directory created when unpacking the archive.

This is convenient because you don’t have to create any directories to start using {{es}}, and uninstalling {{es}} is as easy as removing the `$ES_HOME` directory. However, you should change the default locations of the config directory, the data directory, and the logs directory so that you do not delete important data later on.

| Type | Description | Default location | Setting |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| home | {{es}} home directory or `$ES_HOME` | Directory created by unpacking the archive |  |
| bin | Binary scripts including `elasticsearch` to start a node    and `elasticsearch-plugin` to install plugins | `$ES_HOME/bin` |  |
| conf | Configuration files including `elasticsearch.yml` | `$ES_HOME/config` | [`ES_PATH_CONF`](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure-elasticsearch.md#config-files-location) |
| conf | Generated TLS keys and certificates for the transport and HTTP layer. | `$ES_HOME/config/certs` |  |
| data | The location of the data files of each index / shard allocated    on the node. | `$ES_HOME/data` | [`path.data`](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/important-settings-configuration.md#path-settings) |
| logs | Log files location. | `$ES_HOME/logs` | [`path.logs`](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/important-settings-configuration.md#path-settings) |
| plugins | Plugin files location. Each plugin will be contained in a subdirectory. | `$ES_HOME/plugins` |  |
| repo | Shared file system repository locations. Can hold multiple locations. A file system repository can be placed in to any subdirectory of any directory specified here. | Not configured | [`path.repo`](/deploy-manage/tools/snapshot-and-restore/shared-file-system-repository.md) |
