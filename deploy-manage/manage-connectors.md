# Manage connectors

% What needs to be done: Align serverless/stateful

% GitHub issue: https://github.com/elastic/docs-projects/issues/352

% Scope notes: Connectors management, probably moving some content to reference. We should align the serverless and stateful documentation.

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/kibana/kibana/action-types.md
%      Notes: 28 children
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/action-connectors.md

* [/raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/action-connectors.md](/raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/action-connectors.md)
