:::{important}
{{agent}} and {{metricbeat}} are the recommended methods for collecting and shipping monitoring data to a monitoring cluster.

If you have previously configured legacy collection methods, you should migrate to using [{{agent}}](/deploy-manage/monitor/stack-monitoring/collecting-monitoring-data-with-elastic-agent.md) or [{{metricbeat}}](/deploy-manage/monitor/stack-monitoring/collecting-monitoring-data-with-metricbeat.md) collection. Do not use legacy collection alongside other collection methods.
