# Collect monitoring data with Metricbeat [monitoring-metricbeat]


In 6.4 and later, you can use {{metricbeat}} to collect data about {{kib}} and ship it to the monitoring cluster, rather than routing it through the production cluster as described in [Legacy collection methods](/deploy-manage/monitor/stack-monitoring/kibana-monitoring-legacy.md).

:alt: Example monitoring architecture
:::

To learn about monitoring in general, see [Monitor a cluster](../../monitor.md).

1. Disable the default collection of {{kib}} monitoring metrics.<br>

    Add the following setting in the {{kib}} configuration file (`kibana.yml`):

    ```yaml
    monitoring.kibana.collection.enabled: false
    ```

    Leave the `monitoring.enabled` set to its default value (`true`). For more information, see [Monitoring settings in {{kib}}](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/monitoring-settings-kb.html).

2. [Start {{kib}}](../../maintenance/start-stop-services/start-stop-kibana.md).
3. Set the `xpack.monitoring.collection.enabled` setting to `true` on each node in the production cluster. By default, it is disabled (`false`).

    ::::{note}
    You can specify this setting in either the `elasticsearch.yml` on each node or across the cluster as a dynamic cluster setting. If {{es}} {security-features} are enabled, you must have `monitor` cluster privileges to view the cluster settings and `manage` cluster privileges to change them.
    ::::


    * In {{kib}}:

        1. Open {{kib}} in your web browser.

            If you are running {{kib}} locally, go to `http://localhost:5601/`.

            If the Elastic {{security-features}} are enabled, log in.

        2. In the side navigation, click **Stack Monitoring**. If data collection is disabled, you are prompted to turn it on.

    * From the Console or command line, set `xpack.monitoring.collection.enabled` to `true` on the production cluster.<br>

        For example, you can use the following APIs to review and change this setting:

        ```js
        GET _cluster/settings

        PUT _cluster/settings
        {
          "persistent": {
            "xpack.monitoring.collection.enabled": true
          }
        }
        ```

        For more information, see [Monitoring settings in {{es}}](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/monitoring-settings.html) and [Cluster update settings](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-cluster-put-settings).

4. [Install {{metricbeat}}](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/current/metricbeat-installation-configuration.html) on the same server as {{kib}}.
5. Enable the {{kib}} {xpack} module in {{metricbeat}}.<br>

    For example, to enable the default configuration in the `modules.d` directory, run the following command:

    ```sh
    metricbeat modules enable kibana-xpack
    ```

    For more information, see [Specify which modules to run](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/current/configuration-metricbeat.html) and [{{kib}} module](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/current/metricbeat-module-kibana.html).

6. Configure the {{kib}} {xpack} module in {{metricbeat}}.<br>

    The `modules.d/kibana-xpack.yml` file contains the following settings:

    ```yaml
    - module: kibana
      metricsets:
        - stats
      period: 10s
      hosts: ["localhost:5601"]
      #basepath: ""
      #username: "user"
      #password: "secret"
      xpack.enabled: true
    ```

    By default, the module collects {{kib}} monitoring metrics from `localhost:5601`. If that host and port number are not correct, you must update the `hosts` setting. If you configured {{kib}} to use encrypted communications, you must access it via HTTPS. For example, use a `hosts` setting like `https://localhost:5601`.

    If the Elastic {{security-features}} are enabled, you must also provide a user ID and password so that {{metricbeat}} can collect metrics successfully:

    1. Create a user on the production cluster that has the `remote_monitoring_collector` [built-in role](../../users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/built-in-roles.md). Alternatively, use the `remote_monitoring_user` [built-in user](../../users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/built-in-users.md).
    2. Add the `username` and `password` settings to the {{kib}} module configuration file.

7. Optional: Disable the system module in {{metricbeat}}.

    By default, the [system module](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/current/metricbeat-module-system.html) is enabled. The information it collects, however, is not shown on the **Monitoring** page in {{kib}}. Unless you want to use that information for other purposes, run the following command:

    ```sh
    metricbeat modules disable system
    ```

8. Identify where to send the monitoring data.<br>

    ::::{tip}
    In production environments, we strongly recommend using a separate cluster (referred to as the *monitoring cluster*) to store the data. Using a separate monitoring cluster prevents production cluster outages from impacting your ability to access your monitoring data. It also prevents monitoring activities from impacting the performance of your production cluster.
    ::::


    For example, specify the {{es}} output information in the {{metricbeat}} configuration file (`metricbeat.yml`):

    ```yaml
    output.elasticsearch:
      # Array of hosts to connect to.
      hosts: ["http://es-mon-1:9200", "http://es-mon2:9200"] <1>

      # Optional protocol and basic auth credentials.
      #protocol: "https"
      #username: "elastic"
      #password: "changeme"
    ```

    1. In this example, the data is stored on a monitoring cluster with nodes `es-mon-1` and `es-mon-2`.


    If you configured the monitoring cluster to use encrypted communications, you must access it via HTTPS. For example, use a `hosts` setting like `https://es-mon-1:9200`.

    ::::{important}
    The {{es}} {monitor-features} use ingest pipelines. The cluster that stores the monitoring data must have at least one node with the `ingest` role.
    ::::


    If the {{es}} {security-features} are enabled on the monitoring cluster, you must provide a valid user ID and password so that {{metricbeat}} can send metrics successfully:

    1. Create a user on the monitoring cluster that has the `remote_monitoring_agent` [built-in role](../../users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/built-in-roles.md). Alternatively, use the `remote_monitoring_user` [built-in user](../../users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/built-in-users.md).
    2. Add the `username` and `password` settings to the {{es}} output information in the {{metricbeat}} configuration file.

    For more information about these configuration options, see [Configure the {{es}} output](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/current/elasticsearch-output.html).

9. [Start {{metricbeat}}](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/metricbeat/current/metricbeat-starting.html).
10. [View the monitoring data in {{kib}}](/deploy-manage/monitor/monitoring-data.md).
