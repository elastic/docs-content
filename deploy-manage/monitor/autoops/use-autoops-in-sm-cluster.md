# Use AutoOps in your self-managed cluster

After successfully connecting your self-managed cluster to {{ecloud}}, you can start using AutoOps.  

## Views in AutoOps

AutoOps offers insights into your cluster by continuously monitoring hundreds of metrics. These insights are presented in a number of views depending on which aspect of your cluster you want to inspect. Learn more about [](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops/views.md).

## Events in AutoOps

When AutoOps finds an issue while monitoring your cluster, it creates an event to give you a detailed root-cause analysis for the issue as well as recommendations to resolve it. Learn more about [](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops/ec-autoops-events.md).
