# AutoOps for self-managed clusters

For ECE ({{ece}}), ECK ({{eck}}), and self-managed clusters, AutoOps can be set up in all supported [regions](ec-autoops-regions.md#autoops-for-self-managed-clusters-regions) through [Cloud Connect](/deploy-manage/cloud-connect.md). More regions are coming soon.

Cloud Connect enables users of ECE, ECK, and self-managed clusters to use {{ecloud}} services. This means you can take advantage of the simplified cluster monitoring, real-time issue detection, and performance recommendations of AutoOps without having to run and manage the underlying infrastructure.

## How it works

To connect your ECE, ECK, or self-managed cluster to AutoOps, you have to use your {{ecloud}} account to install {{agent}} so that it can pull data from your {{es}} cluster. 

The agent first registers your cluster with {{ecloud}} using the Cloud Connect API, and then exports the data to AutoOps in your selected CSP region. Refer to [](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops/cc-connect-self-managed-to-autoops.md) for instructions on how to get started.

After this setup is complete, you can start using AutoOps to monitor your cluster. Learn more about what you can do with AutoOps in [events](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops/ec-autoops-events.md) and [views](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops/views.md).
