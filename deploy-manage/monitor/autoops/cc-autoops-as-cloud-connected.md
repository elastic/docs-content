# AutoOps as a cloud connected service

Use [AutoOps](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops.md) with your self-managed cluster through Cloud Connect. Cloud Connect enables users of self-managed clusters to use {{ecloud}} services by connecting to the {{ecloud}}. This means you can take advantage of the simplified cluster monitoring, real-time issue detection, and performance recommendations of AutoOps without having to run and manage the underlying infrastructure.

To use AutoOps with Cloud Connect, you first need to create an {{ecloud}} account or log in to your existing account. Once you choose to connect AutoOps to your self-managed cluster, an installation wizard will then guide you through the steps of installing an Elastic agent to send metrics from your self-managed cluster to AutoOps in {{ecloud}}.  

The setup only takes about 10 minutes to complete.
