# AutoOps for self-managed clusters

For ECE ({{ece}}), ECK ({{eck}}), and self-managed clusters, AutoOps can be set up in all supported [regions](ec-autoops-regions.md#autoops-for-self-managed-clusters-regions) through [Cloud Connect](/deploy-manage/cloud-connect.md). More regions are coming soon.

Cloud Connect enables users of ECE, ECK, and self-managed clusters to use {{ecloud}} services. This means you can take advantage of the simplified cluster monitoring, real-time issue detection, and performance recommendations of AutoOps without having to run and manage the underlying infrastructure.
