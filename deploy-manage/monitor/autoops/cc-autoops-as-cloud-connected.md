# AutoOps for self-managed clusters

Use [AutoOps](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops.md) with your self-managed cluster through [Cloud Connect](/deploy-manage/cloud-connect.md). 

Cloud Connect enables users of self-managed clusters to use {{ecloud}} services by connecting to the {{ecloud}}. This means you can take advantage of the simplified cluster monitoring, real-time issue detection, and performance recommendations of AutoOps without having to run and manage the underlying infrastructure.
