$$$single-cloud-org$$$**I’m trying to create a Cloud organization, but I’m already part of a different one.**
:   :::{include} /deploy-manage/monitor/_snippets/single-cloud-org.md
:::

$$$unistall-agent$$$**I need to uninstall {{agent}}.**
:   Refer to [](/solutions/security/configure-elastic-defend/uninstall-elastic-agent.md) for instructions.

$$$disconnected-cluster$$$**My cluster was disconnected from {{ecloud}} and I want to reconnect it.**
:   If the cluster was disconnected by one of the users in your Cloud organization, you can repeat the [installation process](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops/cc-connect-self-managed-to-autoops.md) to reconnect. If not, explore [additional resources](/troubleshoot/index.md#troubleshoot-additional-resources) or [contact us](/troubleshoot/index.md#contact-us).

$$$next-steps$$$**After running the installation command, I can't move on to the next steps.**
:   If an error appears on the screen, follow the suggestion in the error message and try to run the command again. If the issue is not resolved, explore [additional resources](/troubleshoot/index.md#troubleshoot-additional-resources) or [contact us](/troubleshoot/index.md#contact-us).

$$$es-cluster-connection-issues$$$**I'm running into issues connecting my self-managed cluster to my {{es}} cluster.**
:   You may be behind a corporate firewall. Run the connection steps within the context of your execution environment. That is, if your chosen installation method is Kubernetes, run the commands from within the pod; for Docker, run the commands from within the    container, and so on. 

    Depending on your chosen authentication method, run the following command:

    :::::{tab-set}
    :group: api-key-or-basic
    
    ::::{tab-item} API key
    :sync: api-key
    
    ```json
curl -XGET -i $AUTOOPS_ES_URL \
  -H "Authorization: ApiKey $AUTOOPS_ES_API_KEY"
    ```
    ::::
    
    ::::{tab-item} Basic
    :sync: basic
    
    ```json
curl -XGET -i $AUTOOPS_ES_URL \
  -u $AUTOOPS_ES_USERNAME
    ```
    ::::
    
    :::::

    The command should return something similar to the following:

    ```json
{
  "name" : "1c72f00a6195",
  "cluster_name" : "my-ccm-cluster",
  "cluster_uuid" : "2O_EjO6kTR6AEVYwL5fPEw",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "9.1.3",
    "build_flavor" : "default",
    "build_type" : "docker",
    "build_hash" : "0c781091a2f57de895a73a1391ff8426c0153c8d",
    "build_date" : "2025-08-24T22:05:04.526302670Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "10.2.2",
    "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "8.19.0",
    "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "8.0.0"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
    ```
    However, if this request fails, your system will return an error indicating one or more reasons for failure as outlined in the table below. 
    
    Use the corresponding proposed solution to fix the issue.

    | Reason for failure | Proposed solution |
    | :--- | :--- |
    | The {{es}} endpoint URL you specified is incorrect/not reachable | - Make sure you are using `http` or `https` correctly. <br> - Make sure you are providing the correct port. The default port is **9200**. <br> - If you have verified that the URL is correct, your network team may need to open the firewall to allow-list this URL. |
    | Your API key is incorrect | - Recheck for typos. <br> - If your cluster is on versions 9.1.0 through 9.1.3, ensure that you have the base64-decoded version of the key by running the following command: <br><br> `echo $AUTOOPS_ES_API_KEY | base64 -d` <br><br> If your key has a colon (:), it is not base64 encoded. If your key has an equal sign (=), it is base64 coded. <br> For versions 9.1.4 and above, both formats will work.|
    | Your username and/or password are incorrect | - Recheck for typos. <br> - Ensure that your provided user has the [necessary privileges](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops/cc-connect-self-managed-to-autoops.md#configure-agent). We do not recommend providing a privileged superuser like `elastic` for this purpose.|
    | You are providing both the API key and username/password | Choose one type of authentication only. |
    | A proxy is blocking communication with your {{es}} cluster | You may have to configure `NO_PROXY`. |
    | You are connecting a local development cluster using Docker without specifying `--network host` | - Make sure you are following all the steps to [connect your local development cluster to AutoOps](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops/cc-connect-local-dev-to-autoops.md#connect-your-local-development-cluster-to-autoops). <br> - In the [Install agent](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops/cc-connect-self-managed-to-autoops.md#install-agent) step, make sure you are replacing `docker run -d \` with `docker run -d --network host \`. |
    | You are using a custom SSL/TLS configuration with {{es}} | Disable SSL/TLS verification so that your system trusts all certificates. We do not recommend disabling verification in production environments. <br><br> If you are using API key authentication, run the following command: <br><br>`curl -XGET --insecure -i $AUTOOPS_ES_URL \ -H "Authorization: ApiKey $AUTOOPS_ES_API_KEY"`. <br><br> If you are using username/password authentication, run the following command: <br><br> `curl -XGET --insecure -i $AUTOOPS_ES_URL \ -u $AUTOOPS_ES_USERNAME` <br><br> If the issue is resolved, you need to configure your custom SSL/TLS settings with {{agent}}. If the issue persists, contact [Elastic support](https://support.elastic.co/).| 
    

$$$cloud-connection-issues$$$**I'm running into issues connecting my self-managed cluster to {{ecloud}}.**
:   You may be behind a corporate firewall. Run the connection steps within the context of your execution environment. That is, if your chosen installation method is Kubernetes, run the commands from within the pod; for Docker, run the commands from within the    container, and so on.

    There are two parts of connecting your self-managed cluster to {{ecloud}}:
  * Registering your cluster with {{ecloud}}
  * Shipping data to {{ecloud}}

    First, to register your cluster with {{ecloud}}, you need to collect some basic information about your cluster and send it to {{ecloud}}. Run the following command:

    ```json
    curl -XPOST -i \
  https://api.elastic-cloud.com/api/v1/cloud-connected/clusters \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"self_managed_cluster": {"id": "my-cluster-uuid", "name": "my-cluster-name", "version": "9.1.0"}, "license": {"uid": "my-license-id", "type": "basic"}}'
     ```
  
    The command should return an HTTP 401 response similar to the following: 

    ```json
        {"UnauthorizedMessages":["Invalid credential headers"],"Cause":null}
    ```
    If you do not receive a similar response, configure your HTTP proxy to allow it to reach the URL (with headers and a JSON body):
    ```json
        POST https://api.elastic-cloud.com/api/v1/cloud-connected/clusters
    ```
    :::{note}
    If you are using Docker, you may need to complete this configuration directly via the `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` environment variables.
    :::

    Next, to ship data to {{ecloud}}, your proxy must allow sending data to a specific URL. This URL depends on the [CSP region](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops/ec-autoops-regions.md) where you have chosen to store your data, and it may change in the future. The following command uses AWS eu-west-1 as an example. Replace the example with your chosen CSP region and run the command: 

    ```json
        curl -XPOST -i \
  https://otel-collector.auto-ops.eu-west-1.aws.cloud.elastic.co:4318/v1/logs \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'

    ```
    The command should return an HTTP 401 response similar to the following: 

    ```json
      {"code":16,"message":"no auth provided"}
    ```

    If you do not receive a similar response, configure your HTTP proxy to allow it to reach the URL (with headers and an arbitrary body):

    ```json
      POST https://otel-collector.auto-ops.${REGION}.${CSP}.cloud.elastic.co:4318/v1/logs
    ```
    :::{note}
    If you are using Docker, you may need to complete this configuration directly via the `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` environment variables.

## Potential errors

The following table shows the errors you might encounter if something goes wrong while you set up and use AutoOps on your clusters.

| Error code | Error message | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `HTTP_401` | Authentication failed | Connection denied because of an authentication error. Verify that your API key and password are correct and all [necessary privileges](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops/cc-connect-self-managed-to-autoops.md#configure-agent) have been granted. |
| `HTTP_502` | Server error | Received an invalid response from the server. Verify the server status and network configuration. |
| `HTTP_503` | Server unavailable | Invalid or corrupt response received from the server. The server acting as a proxy may be busy or undergoing scheduled maintenance. If the issue persists, check the cluster's health and resource usage. |
| `HTTP_504` | Request timed out | Did not receive a response from the cluster within the expected time frame. Check the cluster's performance or consider changing your connection timeout settings. |
| `CLUSTER_ALREADY_CONNECTED` | Cluster connected to another account | This cluster is already connected to another {{ecloud}} organization. Disconnect it and then try again. |
| `CLUSTER_NOT_READY` | {{es}} cluster is still connecting | Your {{es}} cluster is not yet ready to connect. Wait a few moments for it to finish starting up and then try again. |
| `HTTP_0` | Connection error | {{agent}} couldn't connect to the cluster. There may be various reasons for this issue. Review the [documentation](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops/cc-autoops-as-cloud-connected.md) or contact [Elastic support](https://support.elastic.co/) if the issue persists. |
| `LICENSE_EXPIRED` | Elastic license is expired | Contact [sales](https://www.elastic.co/contact#sales) to renew your license. |
| `LICENSE_USED_BY_ANOTHER_ACCOUNT` | License key connected to another account | A license key can only be connected to one {{ecloud}} organization. Contact [Elastic support](https://support.elastic.co/) for help. |
| `VERSION_MISMATCH` | {{es}} version is unsupported | Upgrade your cluster to a [supported version](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol). |
| `UNKNOWN_ERROR` | Installation failed | {{agent}} couldn't be installed due to an unknown issue. Consult the troubleshooting guide or contact [Elastic support](https://support.elastic.co/) for more help. |
| | Failed to register Cloud Connected Mode: cluster license type is not supported | The cluster you are trying to connect doesn't have the required license to connect to AutoOps. For more information, refer to the [prerequisites](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops/cc-connect-self-managed-to-autoops.md#prerequisites). |
