$$$disconnected-cluster$$$My cluster was disconnected from {{ecloud}} and I want to reconnect it.
:   If the cluster was disconnected by one of the users in your Cloud organization, you can repeat the [installation process](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops/cc-connect-self-managed-to-autoops.md) to reconnect. If not, explore [additional resources](/troubleshoot/index.md#troubleshoot-additional-resources) or [contact us](/troubleshoot/index.md#contact-us).

$$$next-steps$$$After running the installation command, I can't move on to the next steps.
:   If an error appears on the screen, follow the suggestion in the error message and try to run the command again. If the issue is not resolved, explore [additional resources](/troubleshoot/index.md#troubleshoot-additional-resources) or [contact us](/troubleshoot/index.md#contact-us).
