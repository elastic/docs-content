# Notifications settings [ec-autoops-notifications-settings]

AutoOps can notify you of new events opened or closed through various methods and operation management tools. With a customizable mechanism, you can specify which events you want to be notified about, how you wish to receive these notifications, and their frequency.

::::{note}
Only organization owners can configure these settings.
::::


To set up notifications you have to:

1. Set up connectors to specify where the notifications will be sent.
2. Add notification filters to determine which events will be sent to each connector.


## AutoOps connectors [ec-autoops-connectors]

To receive notifications for new events, the first step is to specify where the notifications should be sent. AutoOps provides a selection of [built-in connectors](#ec-built-in-connectors) to choose from. You can set up multiple connectors, even of the same type, based on your needs.


## Set up a connector [ec-setup-autoops-connectors]

1. On the **Notifications Settings** page, navigate to the **Connector Settings** tab and click **Add**.
2. From the drop-down list, choose the connector you want to set up and follow the instructions.
3. Click **Validate** to send a test message.
4. Save your settings.


## Add notification filters [ec-add-notification-filters]

A notification filter lets you choose which events to receive notifications for and how you want to be notified. You can create an unlimited number of filters, and the same connector can be used across multiple filters.

To set up a filter, follow these steps:

1. On the **Notification settings** page, navigate to the **Filter Setting** tab and click **Add**.
2. Choose a name that best describes the type of alert notification. This name will appear in other reports and dashboards.
3. Select the deployments that the new created events will trigger the alert for.
4. Select the connectors to receive the notification.
5. Use the **Delay** field to set the period of time AutoOps will hold before sending the notification. If during this time all of the events listed in this filter are closed by AutoOps, no notification will be sent.
6. Choose the type of events this filter applies to.

    * TITLE – The title of the event.
    * DESCRIPTION – The description of the issue that was found.
    * SEVERITY – One of the 3 severity levels (High, Medium and Low).
    * STATUS – Indicate if the event is currently open or close.
    * MESSAGE – The background and impact of the issue
    * START_TIME – The time the event was open.
    * END_TIME – The time the event was closed.
    * ENDPOINT_TYPE – The type of the endpoint (Slack, PagerDuty, Webhook, Opsgenie, VictorOps and MS Teams).
    * AFFECTED_NODES – List of node names.
    * AFFECTED_INDICES – List of indices names.
    * EVENT_LINK – Direct link to the event in AutoOps.

## Notifications report [ec-notification-report]

From the **Notifications** report, you can check all the notifications sent. The report lists all the events that were set up in the notification filters and provide their status.
