## AutoOps key features [ec_autoops_key_features]

* Real-time root-cause analysis for hundreds of issues.
* Accurate resolution paths and customized recommendations.
* Insight into what occurred and detailed views into nodes, index, shards, and templates.
* Wide range of insights, including:

    * Cluster status, node failures, and shard sizes.
    * High CPU, memory, disk usage, and other resource-related metrics.
    * Misconfigurations and possible optimizations.
    * Insights on data structure, shards, templates, and mapping optimizations.
    * Unbalanced loads between nodes.
    * Indexing latency, rejections, search latency, high index/search queues, and slow queries.
    * Resource utilization.



## Additional capabilities [ec_additional_capabilities]

* Multi-deployment dashboard to quickly spot issues across all clusters.
* Possibility to customize event triggers and connect to different notification services such as PagerDuty, Slack, MS Teams, and webhooks.
* Long-term reports for sustained evaluation. This feature is currently not available and will be rolled out shortly.

## AutoOps availability

In the [regions](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops/ec-autoops-regions.md) where it has been rolled out, AutoOps is automatically available in [{{ech}} deployments](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops/ec-autoops-how-to-access.md) and [{{serverless-full}} projects](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops/autoops-for-serverless.md), and can be set up for [ECE, ECK, and self-managed clusters](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops/cc-autoops-as-cloud-connected.md).

AutoOps is currently not available for air-gapped environments since it is a cloud service and you need an internet connection to send metrics to {{ecloud}}. However, we plan to offer a locally deployable version in the future.

## AutoOps retention period [ec_autoops_retention_period]

AutoOps currently has a 10 day retention period.


## AutoOps scope [ec_autoops_scope]

AutoOps currently monitors only {{es}}, not the entire {{stack}}. Any deployment information pertains solely to {{es}}. AutoOps is compatible with [supported {{es}} versions](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol)(7.17.x and above). We plan to expand AutoOps monitoring to the entire stack in the future.
