# Cloud deployment health and performance metrics

{{ece}} and {{ech}} provide out of the box tools for monitoring the health of your deployment and resolving health issues when they arise.

These features augment [AutoOps](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops.md) and [stack monitoring](/deploy-manage/monitor/stack-monitoring.md) features. These more complete monitoring features should be used if you plan to use your cluster in production.

## Cluster health [ec-es-cluster-health]

Health is reported based on the following areas: Shard availability, master node health, Snapshot Lifecycle Management (SLM), Index Lifecycle Management (ILM), and repository integrity.

The deployment **Health** page provides detailed information on health issues, impacted areas, and troubleshooting support.

To view the health for a deployment:

:::{include} ../_snippets/find-manage-deployment-ech-and-ece.md
:::

3. Under the deployment's name in the navigation menu, select **Health**.

The **Health** page provides the following information:

* Health issues for {{kib}}, Enterprise Search, APM, and plan changes are reported in the health banner.
* Health issues for {{es}} clusters are broken down into a table with more details on Severity, Description and Affected capabilities.

:::{image} /deploy-manage/images/cloud-es-health-page.png
:alt: {{es}} Health page
:::

* **Severity**: A critical issue impacts operations such as search and ingest and should be addressed as soon as possible. Warnings don’t impact the cluster immediately but might lead to more critical issues over time such as a corrupted repository might lead to no backups being available in the future. |
* **Description**: For most issues, you can click the description to get more details page on the specific issue and on how to fix it.
* **Affected capabilities**: Each of these areas might impact search, ingest, backups, or deployment management capabilities.

You can also search and filter the table based on affected resources, such as indices, repositories, nodes, or SLM policies. Individual issues can be further expanded to get more details and guided troubleshooting.

For more information about specific errors, refer to [](/troubleshoot/elasticsearch.md). You can also [contact us](/troubleshoot/index.md#contact-us) if you need more help.

### Health warnings [ec-es-health-warnings]

In the normal course of using your {{ech}} and {{ece}} deployments, health warnings and errors might appear from time to time. Following are the most common scenarios and methods to resolve them.

| Category | Resolution |
| --- | --- |
| Health warning messages | Health warning messages will sometimes appear on the main page for one of your deployments, as well as on the **Logs and metrics** page.<br><br>For {{ech}} deployments, these messages might reflect routine maintenance activity occurring on {{ecloud}}.|
| Configuration change failures | In more serious cases, your deployment may be unable to restart. The failure can be due to a variety of causes, the most frequent of these being invalid secure settings, expired plugins or bundles, or out of memory errors. The problem is often not detected until an attempt is made to restart the deployment following a routine configuration change, such as a deployment resizing. |
| Out of memory errors | Out of memory errors (OOMs) may occur during your deployment’s normal operations, and these can have a very negative impact on performance. Common causes of memory shortages are oversharding, data retention oversights, and the overall request volume.<br><br>On your deployment page, you can check the [JVM memory pressure indicator](/deploy-manage/monitor/ec-memory-pressure.md) to get the current memory usage of each node of your deployment. You can also review the [common causes of high JVM memory usage](/deploy-manage/monitor/ec-memory-pressure.md#ec-memory-pressure-causes) to help diagnose the source of unexpectedly high memory pressure levels. To learn more, refer to [](/troubleshoot/monitoring/high-memory-pressure.md). |

#### Cluster restarts after out-of-memory failures [ec_cluster_restarts_after_out_of_memory_failures]
```{applies_to}
deployment:
  ess:
```

For clusters that suffer out-of-memory failures, it can be difficult to determine whether the clusters are in a completely healthy state afterwards. For this reason, {{ech}} automatically reboots clusters that suffer out-of-memory failures.

You will receive an email notification to let you know that a restart occurred. For repeated alerts, the emails are aggregated so that you do not receive an excessive number of notifications. Either [resizing your cluster to reduce memory pressure](/deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/ec-customize-deployment-components.md#ec-cluster-size) or reducing the workload that a cluster is being asked to handle can help avoid these cluster restarts.

## Cluster performance [ec-es-cluster-performance]

```{applies_to}
deployment:
  ess:
```

{{ech}} deployments offer an additional **Performance** page to get further information about your cluster performance.

If you observe issues on search and ingest operations in terms of increased latency or throughput for queries, these might not be directly reported on the **Health** page, unless they are related to shard health or master node availability.

The **Performance** page and the out-of-the-box logs allow you to monitor your cluster performance, but for production applications we strongly recommend setting up a dedicated monitoring cluster. Refer to [Understanding deployment health](#ec-health-best-practices), for more guidelines on how to monitor you cluster performance.

[Learn more about the performance page and the metrics it captures](/deploy-manage/monitor/access-performance-metrics-on-elastic-cloud.md).

:::{tip}
For {{ece}} deployments, you can use [platform monitoring](/deploy-manage/monitor/orchestrators/ece-platform-monitoring.md) to access preconfigured performance metrics.
:::

## JVM memory pressure indicator

{{ech}} and {{ece}} also provide a [JVM memory pressure indicator](/deploy-manage/monitor/ec-memory-pressure.md) for each node in your cluster in your deployment overview. This indicator can help you to determine when you need to upgrade to a larger cluster.

## Preconfigured logs and metrics [ec-es-health-preconfigured]

Both {{ech}} and {{ece}} offer out-of-the-box logs and metrics that you can access to get insight into your deployment's performance.

:::{admonition} Monitoring in production environments
In a production environment, it’s important set up dedicated health monitoring using [stack monitoring](/deploy-manage/monitor/stack-monitoring/ece-ech-stack-monitoring.md). Stack monitoring allows you to retain the logs and metrics that can be used to troubleshoot any health issues in your deployments. In the event of that you need to [contact our support team](/troubleshoot/index.md#contact-us), they can use the retained data to help diagnose any problems that you may encounter.

You have the option of sending logs and metrics to a separate, specialized monitoring deployment, which ensures that they’re available in the event of a deployment outage. The monitoring deployment also gives you access to {{kib}} stack monitoring features, through which you can view health and performance data for all of your deployment resources.
:::

### In {{ech}}

In a non-production {{ech}} environment, you may choose to rely on the logs and metrics that are available for your deployment by default. The deployment **Logs and metrics** page displays any current deployment health warnings, and from there you can also view standard log files from the last 24 hours.

The logs capture any activity related to your deployments, their component resources, snapshotting behavior, and more. You can use the search bar to filter the logs by, for example, a specific instance (`instance-0000000005`), a configuration file (`roles.yml`), an operation type (`snapshot`, `autoscaling`), or a component (`kibana`, `ent-search`).

### In {{ece}}

In {{ece}}, you can use [platform monitoring](/deploy-manage/monitor/orchestrators/ece-platform-monitoring.md) to view deployment logs and metrics, as well as proxy logs. From your deployment page, select either the **Elasticsearch**, **Kibana**, and **Integrations Server** components, and use the external links to access each service's logs and metrics.

## vCPU credit monitoring

```{applies_to}
deployment:
  ess:
```

{{ecloud}} allows smaller instance sizes to get temporarily boosted vCPU when under heavy load. [vCPU boosting](/deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/ec-vcpu-boost-instance.md) is governed by vCPU credits that instances can earn over time when vCPU usage is less than the assigned amount.

You can check the **Monitoring > Performance > CPU Credits** section of the [{{ecloud}} Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body), and find the related metrics:

:::{image} /deploy-manage/images/cloud-metrics-credits.png
:alt: CPU usage versus CPU credits over time
:::

If you need your cluster to be able to sustain a certain level of performance, you can't rely on CPU boosting to handle the workload except temporarily. To ensure that performance can be sustained, consider increasing the size of your cluster. Refer to [](/troubleshoot/monitoring/performance.md) for more guidance.
