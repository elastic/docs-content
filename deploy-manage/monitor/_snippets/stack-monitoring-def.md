Stack monitoring allows you to collect logs and metrics from various Elastic products, including {{es}} nodes, {{ls}} nodes, {{kib}} instances, APM Server, and Beats in your cluster. You can also collect logs.

All of the monitoring metrics are stored in {{es}}, which enables you to easily visualize the data in {{kib}}.
