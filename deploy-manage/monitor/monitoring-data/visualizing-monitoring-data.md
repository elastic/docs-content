# Visualizing monitoring data [xpack-monitoring]

The {{kib}} {monitor-features} serve two separate purposes:

1. To visualize monitoring data from across the {{stack}}. You can view health and performance data for {{es}}, {{ls}}, {{ents}}, APM, and Beats in real time, as well as analyze past performance.
2. To monitor {{kib}} itself and route that data to the monitoring cluster.

If you enable monitoring across the {{stack}}, each monitored component is considered unique based on its persistent UUID, which is written to the [`path.data`](../../deploy/self-managed/configure.md) directory when the node or instance starts.

For more information, see [Configure monitoring](../stack-monitoring/kibana-monitoring-self-managed.md) and [Monitor a cluster](../../monitor.md).

Want to monitor your fleet of {{agent}}s, too? Use {{fleet}} instead of the Stack Monitoring UI. To learn more, refer to [Monitor {{agent}}s](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/monitor-elastic-agent.html).
