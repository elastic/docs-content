# Configure audit logging [audit-logging-configuration]

When auditing security events, a single client request might generate multiple audit events across multiple cluster nodes, potentially leading to a high volume of log data and I/O operations. To maintain clarity and ensure logs remain actionable, {{es}} and {{kib}} provide configuration mechanisms to control what events are logged and which can be ignored.

### Elasticsearch auditing configuration

{{es}} configuration options include:

  * [{{es}} audited events settings](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/auditing-settings.html#event-audit-settings): Use include and exclude filters to control the types of events that get logged.
  * [{{es}} node information settings](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/auditing-settings.html#node-audit-settings): Control whether to add or hide node information such as hostname or IP address in the audited events.
  * [{{es}} ignore policies settings](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/auditing-settings.html#audit-event-ignore-policies): Use ignore policies for fine-grained control over which audit events are printed to the log file.

    ::::{tip}
    In {{es}}, all auditing settings except `xpack.security.audit.enabled` are dynamic. This means you can configure them using the [cluster update settings API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cluster-update-settings.html), allowing changes to take effect immediately without requiring a restart. This approach is faster and more convenient than modifying `elasticsearch.yml`. 
    ::::

For a complete description of event details and format, refer to the following resources:
  * [{{es}} audit events details and schema]() asciidocalypse://elasticsearch/docs/reference/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-audit-events
  * [{{es}} log entry output format](/deploy-manage/monitor/logging-configuration/logfile-audit-output.md#audit-log-entry-format)

### Kibana auditing configuration

To control the logs that are outputted by Kibana, you can use [{{kib}} ignore filters](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/security-settings-kb.html#audit-logging-ignore-filters). These are a list of filters that determine which events should be excluded from the audit log.

In self-managed systems, you can optionally configure audit logs location, and file/rolling file using [{{kib}} audit logging settings](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/security-settings-kb.html#audit-logging-settings).


::::{tip}
To configure {{kib}} settings, follow the same [procedure](./enabling-audit-logs.md#enable-audit-logging-procedure) as when enabling {{kib}} audit logs, but apply the relevant settings instead.
::::

For a complete description of auditing event details, such as `category`, `type`, or `action`, refer to [{{kib}} audit events](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/xpack-security-audit-logging.html#xpack-security-ecs-audit-logging).

### General recommendations

* Consider starting with {{es}} [`xpack.security.audit.logfile.events.include`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/auditing-settings.html#xpack-sa-lf-events-include) and [{{kib}} ignore filters](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/security-settings-kb.html#audit-logging-ignore-filters) settings to specify the type of events you want to include or exclude in the auditing output.

* If you need a more granular control, refer to [{{es}} audit events ignore policies](./logfile-audit-events-ignore-policies.md) for a better understanding how ignore policies work and when they are beneficial.

* Refer to [auditing search queries](./auditing-search-queries.md) for details on logging request bodies in the {{es}} audit logs.

  ::::{important}
  Sensitive data may be audited in plain text when including the request body in audit events, even though all the security APIs, such as those that change the userâ€™s password, have the credentials filtered out when audited.
