# Kibana logging [logging-configuration]

You do not need to configure any additional settings to use the logging features in Kibana. Logging is enabled by default.

In all deployment types, you might want to change the log level for {{kib}}. In a self-managed, ECE, or ECK deployment, you might want to further customize your logging settings to define where log messages are displayed, stored, and formatted, or provide granular settings for different loggers.

* [](/deploy-manage/monitor/logging-configuration/kibana-log-levels.md)
* [](/deploy-manage/monitor/logging-configuration/kib-advanced-logging.md)

You can also configure [{{kib}} task manager health monitoring](/deploy-manage/monitor/kibana-task-manager-health-monitoring.md) using logging settings.

:::{tip}
For additional information about the available logging settings, refer to the [{{kib}} configuration reference](kibana://reference/configuration-reference/logging-settings.md).

## Access {{kib}} logs

The way that you access your logs differs depending on your deployment method.

### Orchestrated deployments

Access your logs using one of the following options: 

* All orchestrated deployments: [](/deploy-manage/monitor/stack-monitoring.md)
* {{ech}}: [Preconfigured logs and metrics](/deploy-manage/monitor/cloud-health-perf.md#ec-es-health-preconfigured)
* {{ece}}: [Platform monitoring](/deploy-manage/monitor/orchestrators/ece-platform-monitoring.md)

### Self-managed deployments

If you run {{kib}} as a service, the default location of the logs varies based on your platform and installation method:

:::::::{tab-set}

::::::{tab-item} Docker
On [Docker](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/install-elasticsearch-with-docker.md), log messages go to the console and are handled by the configured Docker logging driver. To access logs, run `docker logs`.
::::::

::::::{tab-item} Debian (APT) and RPM
For [Debian](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/install-elasticsearch-with-debian-package.md) and [RPM](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/install-elasticsearch-with-rpm.md) installations, {{es}} writes logs to `/var/log/kibana`.
::::::

::::::{tab-item} macOS and Linux
For [macOS and Linux `.tar.gz`](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/install-elasticsearch-from-archive-on-linux-macos.md) installations, {{es}} writes logs to `$KIBANA_HOME/logs`.

Files in `$KIBANA_HOME` risk deletion during an upgrade. In production, you should configure a [different location for your logs](/deploy-manage/monitor/logging-configuration/kib-advanced-logging.md).
::::::

::::::{tab-item} Windows .zip
For [Windows `.zip`](/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/install-elasticsearch-with-zip-on-windows.md) installations, {{es}} writes logs to `%KIBANA_HOME%\logs`.

Files in `%KIBANA_HOME%` risk deletion during an upgrade. In production, you should configure a [different location for your logs](/deploy-manage/monitor/logging-configuration/kib-advanced-logging.md).
::::::

:::::::

If you run {{kib}} from the command line, {{es}} prints logs to the standard output (`stdout`).

You can also consume logs using [stack monitoring](/deploy-manage/monitor/stack-monitoring/kibana-monitoring-self-managed.md).
