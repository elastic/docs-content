# Correlating Kibana and Elasticsearch audit logs [xpack-security-audit-logging]

Audit logging is a [subscription feature](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions) that you can enable to keep track of security-related events, such as authorization success and failures. Logging these events enables you to monitor {{kib}} for suspicious activity and provides evidence in the event of an attack.

Use the {{kib}} audit logs in conjunction with [{{es}} audit logging](enabling-elasticsearch-audit-logs.md) to get a holistic view of all security related events. {{kib}} defers to the {{es}} security model for authentication, data index authorization, and features that are driven by cluster-wide privileges. For more information on enabling audit logging in {{es}}, refer to [Auditing security events](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/auditing.html).

::::{note}
Audit logs are **disabled** by default. To enable this functionality, you must set `xpack.security.audit.enabled` to `true` in `kibana.yml`.

You can optionally configure audit logs location, file/rolling file appenders and ignore filters using [Audit logging settings](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/security-settings-kb.html#audit-logging-settings).

::::


## Audit events [xpack-security-ecs-audit-logging]

Refer to the table of events that can be logged for auditing purposes.

Each event is broken down into [category](enabling-kibana-audit-logs.md#field-event-category), [type](enabling-kibana-audit-logs.md#field-event-type), [action](enabling-kibana-audit-logs.md#field-event-action) and [outcome](enabling-kibana-audit-logs.md#field-event-outcome) fields to make it easy to filter, query and aggregate the resulting logs. The [trace.id](enabling-kibana-audit-logs.md#field-trace-id) field can be used to correlate multiple events that originate from the same request.

Refer to [Audit schema](enabling-kibana-audit-logs.md#xpack-security-ecs-audit-schema) for a table of fields that get logged with audit event.

::::{note}
To ensure that a record of every operation is persisted even in case of an unexpected error, asynchronous write operations are logged immediately after all authorization checks have passed, but before the response from {{es}} is received. Refer to the corresponding {{es}} logs for potential write errors.

## Correlating audit events [xpack-security-ecs-audit-correlation]

Audit events can be correlated in two ways:

1. Multiple {{kib}} audit events that resulted from the same request can be correlated together.
2. If [{{es}} audit logging](enabling-elasticsearch-audit-logs.md) is enabled, {{kib}} audit events from one request can be correlated with backend calls that create {{es}} audit events.

::::{note}
The examples below are simplified, many fields have been omitted and values have been shortened for clarity.
::::


### Example 1: correlating multiple {{kib}} audit events [_example_1_correlating_multiple_kib_audit_events]

When "thom" creates a new alerting rule, five audit events are written:

```json
{"event":{"action":"http_request","category":["web"],"outcome":"unknown"},"http":{"request":{"method":"post"}},"url":{"domain":"localhost","path":"/api/alerting/rule","port":5601,"scheme":"https"},"user":{"name":"thom","roles":["superuser"]},"kibana":{"space_id":"default","session_id":"3dHCZRB..."},"@timestamp":"2022-01-25T13:05:34.449-05:00","message":"User is requesting [/api/alerting/rule] endpoint","trace":{"id":"e300e06..."}}

```

All of these audit events can be correlated together by the same `trace.id` value `"e300e06..."`. The first event is the HTTP API call, the next audit events are checks to validate the space and the connectors, and the last audit event is the actual rule creation.


### Example 2: correlating a {{kib}} audit event with {{es}} audit events [_example_2_correlating_a_kib_audit_event_with_es_audit_events]

When "thom" logs in, a "user_login" {{kib}} audit event is written:

```json
{"event":{"action":"user_login","category":["authentication"],"outcome":"success"},"kibana":{"session_id":"ab93zdA..."},"user":{"name":"thom","roles":["superuser"]},"@timestamp":"2022-01-25T09:40:39.267-05:00","message":"User [thom] has logged in using basic provider [name=basic]","trace":{"id":"818cbf3..."}}
```

The `trace.id` value `"818cbf3..."` in the {{kib}} audit event can be correlated with the `opaque_id` value in these six {{es}} audit events:

```json
{"type":"audit", "timestamp":"2022-01-25T09:40:38,604-0500", "event.action":"access_granted", "user.name":"thom", "user.roles":["superuser"], "request.id":"YCx8wxs...", "action":"cluster:admin/xpack/security/user/authenticate", "request.name":"AuthenticateRequest", "opaque_id":"818cbf3..."}
{"type":"audit", "timestamp":"2022-01-25T09:40:38,613-0500", "event.action":"access_granted", "user.name":"kibana_system", "user.roles":["kibana_system"], "request.id":"Ksx73Ad...", "action":"indices:data/write/index", "request.name":"IndexRequest", "indices":[".kibana_security_session_1"], "opaque_id":"818cbf3..."}
{"type":"audit", "timestamp":"2022-01-25T09:40:38,613-0500", "event.action":"access_granted", "user.name":"kibana_system", "user.roles":["kibana_system"], "request.id":"Ksx73Ad...", "action":"indices:data/write/bulk", "request.name":"BulkRequest", "opaque_id":"818cbf3..."}
{"type":"audit", "timestamp":"2022-01-25T09:40:38,613-0500", "event.action":"access_granted", "user.name":"kibana_system", "user.roles":["kibana_system"], "request.id":"Ksx73Ad...", "action":"indices:data/write/bulk[s]", "request.name":"BulkShardRequest", "indices":[".kibana_security_session_1"], "opaque_id":"818cbf3..."}
{"type":"audit", "timestamp":"2022-01-25T09:40:38,613-0500", "event.action":"access_granted", "user.name":"kibana_system", "user.roles":["kibana_system"], "request.id":"Ksx73Ad...", "action":"indices:data/write/index:op_type/create", "request.name":"BulkItemRequest", "indices":[".kibana_security_session_1"], "opaque_id":"818cbf3..."}
{"type":"audit", "timestamp":"2022-01-25T09:40:38,613-0500", "event.action":"access_granted", "user.name":"kibana_system", "user.roles":["kibana_system"], "request.id":"Ksx73Ad...", "action":"indices:data/write/bulk[s][p]", "request.name":"BulkShardRequest", "indices":[".kibana_security_session_1"], "opaque_id":"818cbf3..."}
```

The {{es}} audit events show that "thom" authenticated, then subsequently "kibana_system" created a session for that user.
