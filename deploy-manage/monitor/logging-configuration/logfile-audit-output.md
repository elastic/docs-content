# Elasticsearch logfile audit output [audit-log-output]

The `logfile` audit output is the only output for auditing. By default, it writes data to the `<clustername>_audit.json` file in the logs directory. The file is also rotated and archived daily or upon reaching the 1GB file size limit.

In self-managed clusters, you can configure how the `logfile` is written in the `log4j2.properties` file located in `ES_PATH_CONF` (or check out the relevant portion of the [log4j2.properties in the sources](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/x-pack/plugin/core/src/main/config/log4j2.properties)). However, **Elastic strongly recommends using the default Log4j2 configuration**.

Orchestrated deployments (ECH, ECE, and ECK) do not support changes in `log4j2.properties` files of the {{es}} instances.

::::{note} 
If you overwrite the `log4j2.properties` and do not specify appenders for any of the audit trails, audit events are forwarded to the root appender, which by default points to the `elasticsearch.log` file.

For {{es}} configuration options that control event filtering in audit logs, refer to [](./configuring-audit-logs.md).

## Log entry format [audit-log-entry-format]

The audit events are formatted as JSON documents, and each event is printed on a separate line in the `<clustername>_audit.json` file. The entries themselves do not contain the end-of-line delimiter. The audit event JSON format is somewhat particular, as **most** fields follow a dotted name syntax, are ordered, and contain non-null string values. This format creates a structured columnar aspect, similar to a CSV, that can be more easily inspected visually (compared to an equivalent nested JSON document).

There are however a few attributes that are exceptions to the above format. The `put`, `delete`, `change`, `create` and `invalidate` attributes, which are only present for events with the `event.type: "security_config_change"` attribute, contain the **nested JSON** representation of the security change taking effect. The contents of the security config change are hence not displayed as top-level dot-named fields in the audit event document. Thatâ€™s because the fields are specific to the particular kind of security change and do not show up in any other audit events. The benefits of a columnar format are therefore much more limited; the space-saving benefits of the nested structure is the favoured trade-off in this case.

When the `request.body` attribute is present (see [Auditing search queries](auditing-search-queries.md)), it contains a string value containing the full HTTP request body, escaped as per the JSON RFC 4677.

Refer to [audit event types](asciidocalypse://docs/elasticsearch/docs/reference/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-audit-events.md) for a complete list of fields, as well as examples, for each entry type.
