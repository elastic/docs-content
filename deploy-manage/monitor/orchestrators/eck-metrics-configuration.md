# ECK metrics configuration [k8s-configure-operator-metrics]

The ECK operator provides a metrics endpoint that can be used to monitor the operatorâ€™s performance and health. By default, the metrics endpoint is not enabled and is not secured. The following sections describe how to enable it, secure it and the associated Prometheus requirements:

* [Enabling the metrics endpoint](k8s-enabling-metrics-endpoint.md)
* [Securing the metrics endpoint](k8s-securing-metrics-endpoint.md)
* [Prometheus requirements](k8s-prometheus-requirements.md)

::::{note} 
The ECK operator metrics endpoint will be secured by default beginning in version 3.0.0.
