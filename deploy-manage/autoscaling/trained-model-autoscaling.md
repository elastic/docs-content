# Trained model autoscaling

% What needs to be done: Align serverless/stateful

% GitHub issue: https://github.com/elastic/docs-projects/issues/344

% Scope notes: Serverless and stateful pages are very similar, might need to merge them together or create subpages

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/general-ml-nlp-auto-scale.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/general-ml-nlp-auto-scale.md
