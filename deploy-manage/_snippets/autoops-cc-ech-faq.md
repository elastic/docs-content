:::{dropdown} Can I use Cloud Connect to connect my {{ech}} clusters to AutoOps?

This path is not supported. Currently, we only support using Cloud Connect to connect ECE, ECK, and self-managed clusters to AutoOps.

For {{ech}} clusters, AutoOps is set up and enabled automatically in all supported [regions](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops/ec-autoops-regions.md), and can be [accessed](/deploy-manage/monitor/autoops/ec-autoops-how-to-access.md) from the deployment overview page.
