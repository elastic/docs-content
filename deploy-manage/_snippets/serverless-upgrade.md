::::{note}
With [{{serverless-full}}](/deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/serverless.md), upgrades of the Elastic-managed infrastructure and project components are fully handled by Elastic. Users automatically receive the latest features and improvements, with no need to plan or perform project-level upgrades.

Keep in mind that the [ingest components](/deploy-manage/upgrade/ingest-components.md) or clients you manage externally, such as {{agent}}, {{beats}}, {{ls}}, or custom applications, still need to be updated manually.
