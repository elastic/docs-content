# Cloud organization users [ec-organizations]

When you sign up to {{ecloud}}, you create an organization. This organization is the umbrella for all of your {{ecloud}} resources, users, and account settings. Every organization has a unique identifier.

You can perform the following tasks to control access to your Cloud organization, your {{ech}} deployments, and your {{serverless-full}} projects:

* [Manage users](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cloud-organization/manage-users.md): Invite users to join your organization and manage existing users.
* Assign [user roles and privileges](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cloud-organization/user-roles.md): 
  * Manage organization-level roles and high-level access to deployments and projects. 
  * If you have {{serverless-full}} projects, assign project-level roles and create custom roles.
* Configure [SAML single sign-on](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cloud-organization/configure-saml-authentication.md) for your organization.

:::{tip}
If you're using {{ech}}, then you can also manage users and control access [at the deployment level](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth.md).
