# Active directory

% What needs to be done: Refine

% GitHub issue: https://github.com/elastic/docs-projects/issues/347

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/active-directory-realm.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud-enterprise/ece-securing-clusters-ad.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$ece-ad-configuration-with-bind-user$$$

$$$ece-ad-configuration-encrypt-communications$$$

$$$ad-realm-configuration$$$
