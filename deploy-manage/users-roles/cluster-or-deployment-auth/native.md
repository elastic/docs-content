# Native

% What needs to be done: Refine

% GitHub issue: https://github.com/elastic/docs-projects/issues/347

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/native-realm.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud-on-k8s/cloud-on-k8s/k8s-users-and-roles.md
%      Notes: native realm content
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/change-passwords-native-users.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/kibana/kibana/tutorial-secure-access-to-kibana.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$k8s-default-elastic-user$$$

$$$managing-native-users$$$
