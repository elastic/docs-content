# Controlling access at the document and field level

% What needs to be done: Refine

% GitHub issue: https://github.com/elastic/docs-projects/issues/347

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/document-level-security.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/field-level-security.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/field-and-document-access-control.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$multiple-roles-dls-fls$$$

$$$templating-role-query$$$
