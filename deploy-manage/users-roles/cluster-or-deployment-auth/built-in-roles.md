# Built-in roles

% What needs to be done: Lift-and-shift

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/built-in-roles.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/kibana/kibana/xpack-security-authorization.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$built-in-roles$$$

$$$built-in-roles-kibana-admin$$$

$$$built-in-roles-remote-monitoring-agent$$$

**This page is a work in progress.** The documentation team is working to combine content pulled from the following pages:

* [/raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/built-in-roles.md](/raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/built-in-roles.md)
* [/raw-migrated-files/kibana/kibana/xpack-security-authorization.md](/raw-migrated-files/kibana/kibana/xpack-security-authorization.md)
