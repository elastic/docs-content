# {{eck}} managed credentials

When deploying an {{stack}} application, the operator generates a set of credentials essential for the operation of that application. For example, these generated credentials include the default `elastic` user for {{es}} and the security token for APM Server.

To list all auto-generated credentials in a namespace, run the following command:

```sh
kubectl get secret -l eck.k8s.elastic.co/credentials=true
```

## Default elastic user [k8s-default-elastic-user]

When the {{es}} resource is created, a default user named `elastic` is created automatically, and is assigned the `superuser` role.

Its password can be retrieved in a Kubernetes secret, whose name is based on the {{es}} resource name: `<elasticsearch-name>-es-elastic-user`.

For example, the password of the `elastic` user for an {{es}} cluster named `quickstart` can be retrieved with:

```sh
kubectl get secret quickstart-es-elastic-user -o go-template='{{.data.elastic | base64decode}}'
```

### Disabling the default `elastic` user [k8s_disabling_the_default_elastic_user]

If your prefer to manage all users via SSO, for example using [SAML Authentication](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/saml.md) or OpenID Connect, you can disable the default `elastic` superuser by setting the `auth.disableElasticUser` field in the {{es}} resource to `true`:

```yaml
apiVersion: elasticsearch.k8s.elastic.co/v1
kind: Elasticsearch
metadata:
  name: elasticsearch-sample
spec:
  version: 8.16.1
  auth:
    disableElasticUser: true
  nodeSets:
  - name: default
    count: 1
```

## Rotate auto-generated credentials [k8s-rotate-credentials]

You can force the auto-generated credentials to be regenerated with new values by deleting the appropriate Secret. For example, to change the password for the `elastic` user from the [quickstart example](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-on-k8s/deploy-an-orchestrator.md), use the following command:

```sh
kubectl delete secret quickstart-es-elastic-user
```

::::{warning}
If you are using the `elastic` user credentials in your own applications, they will fail to connect to {{es}} and Kibana after you run this command. It is not recommended to use `elastic` user credentials for production use cases. Always [create your own users with restricted roles](../../../deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/native.md) to access Elasticsearch.

To regenerate all auto-generated credentials in a namespace, run the following command:

```sh
kubectl delete secret -l eck.k8s.elastic.co/credentials=true
```

::::{warning}
This command regenerates auto-generated credentials of **all** {{stack}} applications in the namespace.
