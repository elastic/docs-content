# Map external users and groups to roles

% What needs to be done: Refine

% GitHub issue: https://github.com/elastic/docs-projects/issues/347

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/mapping-roles.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/kibana/kibana/role-mappings.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/role-mapping-resources.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$mapping-roles-file$$$

$$$ldap-role-mapping$$$

$$$mapping-roles-api$$$

$$$mapping-roles-rule-field$$$

**This page is a work in progress.** The documentation team is working to combine content pulled from the following pages:

* [/raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/mapping-roles.md](/raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/mapping-roles.md)
* [/raw-migrated-files/kibana/kibana/role-mappings.md](/raw-migrated-files/kibana/kibana/role-mappings.md)
* [/raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/role-mapping-resources.md](/raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/role-mapping-resources.md)
