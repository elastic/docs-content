# Set up SAML with Microsoft Entra ID [ec-securing-clusters-saml-azure]

This guide provides a walk-through of how to configure Microsoft Entra ID, formerly known as Azure Active Directory, as an identity provider for SAML single sign-on (SSO) authentication, used for accessing {{kib}} in {{ech}}.

For more information about SAML configuration, refer to:

* [Secure your clusters with SAML](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/saml.md)
* [Single Sign-On SAML protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/single-sign-on-saml-protocol)


## Configure SAML with Microsoft Entra ID to access {{kib}} [ec-securing-clusters-saml-azure-kibana]

Follow these steps to configure SAML with Microsoft Entra ID as an identity provider to access {{kib}}.

1. Configure the Entra Identity Provider:

    1. Log in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and navigate to **Entra** (formerly Azure Active Directory).
    2. Click **Enterprise applications** and then **New application** to register a new application.
    3. Click **Create your own application**, provide a name, and select the **Integrate any other application you don’t find in the gallery** option.

        :::

    4. Navigate to the new application, click **Users and groups**, and add all necessary users and groups. Only the users and groups that you add here will have SSO access to the {{stack}}.

        :::

    5. Navigate to **Single sign-on** and edit the basic SAML configuration, adding the following information:

        * `Identifier (Entity ID)` - a string that uniquely identifies a SAML service provider. We recommend using your {{kib}} URL, but you can use any identifier.

            For example, `https://saml-azure.kb.northeurope.azure.elastic-cloud.com:443`.

        * `Reply URL` - This is the {{kib}} URL with `/api/security/saml/callback` appended.

            For example, `https://saml-azure.kb.northeurope.azure.elastic-cloud.com:443/api/security/saml/callback`.

        * `Logout URL` - This is the {{kib}} URL with `/logout` appended.

            For example, `https://saml-azure.kb.northeurope.azure.elastic-cloud.com:443/logout`.

            :::

    6. Navigate to **SAML-based Single sign-on**, open the **User Attributes & Claims** configuration, and update the fields to suit your needs. These settings control what information from  will be made available to the {{stack}} during SSO. This information can be used to identify a user in the {{stack}} and/or to assign different roles to users in the {{stack}}. We suggest that you configure a proper value for the `Unique User Identifier (Name ID)` claim that identifies the user uniquely and is not prone to changes.

        :::

    7. From the SAML configuration page, make a note of the `App Federation Metadata URL`.

2. Configure {{es}} and {{kib}} for SAML:

    1. [Update your {{es}} user settings](/deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/edit-stack-settings.md) with the following configuration:

        ```sh
        xpack.security.authc.realms.saml.kibana-realm:
          order: 2
          attributes.principal: nameid
          attributes.groups: "http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/groups"
          idp.metadata.path: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<Tenant ID>/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml?appid=<Application_ID>"
          idp.entity_id: "https://sts.windows.net/<Tenant_ID>/"
          sp.entity_id: "<Kibana_Endpoint_URL>"
          sp.acs: "<Kibana_Endpoint_URL>/api/security/saml/callback"
          sp.logout: "<Kibana_Endpoint_URL>/logout"
        ```

        Where:

        * `<Application_ID>` is your Application ID, available in the application details in Azure.
        * `<Tenant_ID>` is your Tenant ID, available in the tenant overview page in Azure.
        * `<Kibana_Endpoint_URL>` is your {{kib}} endpoint, available from the {{ech}} console. Ensure this is the same value that you set for `Identifier (Entity ID)` in the earlier Microsoft Entra ID configuration step.

            For `idp.metadata.path`, we’ve shown the format to construct the URL. This value should be identical to the `App Federation Metadata URL` setting that you made a note of in the previous step.

            If you're using {{ece}} or {{ech}}, and you're using machine learning or a deployment with hot-warm architecture, you must include this configuration in the user settings section for each node type.

    2. Next, configure {{kib}} to enable SAML authentication:
        1. [Update your {{kib}} user settings](/deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/edit-stack-settings.md) with the following configuration:

            ```yaml
            xpack.security.authc.providers:
              saml.kibana-realm:
                order: 0
                realm: kibana-realm
                description: "Log in with Microsoft Entra ID"
            ```

            The configuration values used in the example above are:

            `xpack.security.authc.providers`
            :   Add `saml` provider to instruct {{kib}} to use SAML SSO as the authentication method.

            `xpack.security.authc.providers.saml.<provider-name>.realm`
            :   Set this to the name of the SAML realm that you have used in your [{{es}} realm configuration](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/saml.md#saml-create-realm). For this example, use the realm name that you configured in the previous step: `kibana-realm`.

        2. Create a role mapping.

            The following role mapping for SAML SSO restricts access to a specific user `(email)` based on the `attributes.principal` email address. This prevents other users on the same domain from having access to your deployment. You can remove the rule or adjust it at your convenience.

            ```json
            POST /_security/role_mapping/SAML_kibana
            {
                "enabled": true,
                "roles": [ "superuser" ],
                "rules" : {
                  "all" : [
                    {
                      "field" : {
                        "realm.name" : "kibana-realm"
                      }
                    },
                    {
                      "field" : {
                        "username" : [
                          "<firstname.lastname>"
                        ]
                      }
                    }
                  ]
                },
                "metadata": { "version": 1 }
            }
            ```

            For more information, refer to [Configure role mapping](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/saml.md#saml-role-mapping) in the {{es}} SAML documentation.


You should now have successfully configured SSO access to {{kib}} with Microsoft Entra ID as the identity provider.
