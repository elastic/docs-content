# LDAP

% What needs to be done: Refine

% GitHub issue: https://github.com/elastic/docs-projects/issues/347

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/ldap-realm.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud-enterprise/ece-securing-clusters-ldap.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$ldap-realm-configuration$$$

$$$tls-ldap$$$

$$$mapping-roles-ldap$$$

$$$ldap-user-metadata$$$
