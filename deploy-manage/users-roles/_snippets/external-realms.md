ldap
:   Uses an external LDAP server to authenticate the users. This realm supports an authentication token in the form of username and password, and requires explicit configuration in order to be used. See [LDAP user authentication](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/ldap.md).

active_directory
:   Uses an external Active Directory Server to authenticate the users. With this realm, users are authenticated by usernames and passwords. See [Active Directory user authentication](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/active-directory.md).

pki
:   Authenticates users using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). This realm works in conjunction with SSL/TLS and identifies the users through the Distinguished Name (DN) of the clientâ€™s X.509 certificates. See [PKI user authentication](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/pki.md).

saml
:   Facilitates authentication using the SAML 2.0 Web SSO protocol. This realm is designed to support authentication through {{kib}} and is not intended for use in the REST API. See [SAML authentication](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/saml.md).

:   Facilitates authentication using OpenID Connect. It enables {{es}} to serve as an OpenID Connect Relying Party (RP) and provide single sign-on (SSO) support in {{kib}}. See [Configuring single sign-on to the {{stack}} using OpenID Connect](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/openid-connect.md).
