# Native user authentication [ece-add-native-users]

If you are adding a small number of users and donâ€™t mind managing them manually, using the local *native* authentication might be the best fit for your team.

1. [Log into the Cloud UI](../../deploy/cloud-enterprise/log-into-cloud-ui.md).
2. Go to **Users** and then **Native users**.
3. Select **Create user**.
4. Provide the user details, select the role, and set their password.

    The password must be a minimum of eight characters.

5. Save your changes. You might also want to verify their access with the credentials you created.
