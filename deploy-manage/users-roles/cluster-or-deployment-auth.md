# Cluster or deployment users

To prevent unauthorized access to your Elastic resources, you need a way to identify users and validate that a user is who they claim to be (*authentication*), and control what data users can access and what tasks they can perform (*authorization*).

In this section, youâ€™ll learn how to set up authentication and authorization at the cluster or deployment level, and learn about the underlying security technologies that Elasticsearch uses to authenticate and authorize requests internally and across services.

This section only covers direct access to and communications with an {{es}} cluster - sometimes known as a deployment - as well as the related {{kib}} instance. To learn about managing access to your {{ecloud}} organization or {{ece}} orchestrator, or to learn how to use single sign-on to access a cluster using your {{ecloud}} credentials, refer to [Manage users and roles](/deploy-manage/users-roles.md).

## Quickstart

If you plan to use native Elasticsearch user and role management, then [follow our quickstart](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/quickstart.md) to learn how to set up basic authentication and authorization features, including [spaces](/deploy-manage/manage-spaces.md), [roles](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/user-roles.md), and [native users](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/native.md).

### User authentication

Set up methods to identify users to the Elasticsearch cluster.

Key tasks for managing user authentication include:

* [Managing built-in users](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/built-in-users.md)
* [Managing users natively](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/native.md)
* [Integrating with external authentication providers](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/external-authentication.md)

You can also learn the basics of Elasticsearch authentication, learn about accounts used to communicate within an Elasticsearch cluster and across services, and perform advanced tasks.

[View all user authentication docs](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/user-authentication.md)

### User authorization

After a user is authenticated, use role-based access control to determine whether the user behind an incoming request is allowed to execute the request.

Key tasks for managing user authorization include: 

* [Defining roles](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/defining-roles.md)
* Assigning [built-in roles](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/built-in-roles.md) or your own roles to users
* Creating [mappings of users and groups to roles](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/mapping-users-groups-to-roles.md) for external authentication providers
* [Setting up field- and document-level security](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/controlling-access-at-document-field-level.md)

You can also learn the basics of Elasticsearch authorization, and perform advanced tasks.

::::{tip}
User roles are also used to control access to [{{kib}} spaces](/deploy-manage/manage-spaces.md).
