% What needs to be done: Write from scratch

% GitHub issue: https://github.com/elastic/docs-projects/issues/347

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud-enterprise/ece-securing-clusters.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud/ec-security.md

⚠️ **This page is a work in progress.** ⚠️

* [/raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud-enterprise/ece-securing-clusters.md](/raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud-enterprise/ece-securing-clusters.md)
* [/raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud/ec-security.md](/raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud/ec-security.md)
