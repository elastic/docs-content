# Manage users

% What needs to be done: Refine

% GitHub issue: https://github.com/elastic/docs-projects/issues/347

% Scope notes: These can all be combined. The tasks are pretty similar between serverless and hosted.

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud/ec-invite-users.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/general-manage-organization.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud/ec-api-organizations.md
%      Notes: api examples

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):
