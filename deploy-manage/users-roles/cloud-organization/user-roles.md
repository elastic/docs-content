# User roles

% What needs to be done: Refine

% GitHub issue: https://github.com/elastic/docs-projects/issues/347

% Scope notes: These can be combined, though the list of roles differs between serverless and hosted, but the tasks for managing them are similar.

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud/ec-user-privileges.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/general-manage-organization.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/custom-roles.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$general-assign-user-roles$$$

$$$general-manage-access-to-organization$$$

$$$general-join-organization-from-existing-cloud-account$$$

$$$general-leave-an-organization$$$
