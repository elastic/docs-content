# Elasticsearch performance optimizations [how-to]

Elasticsearch’s default settings provide a good out-of-box experience for basic operations like full text search, highlighting, aggregations, and indexing.

However, there are a number of optimizations you can make to improve performance for your use case.

This section provides recommendations for various use cases.

* [General recommendations](general-recommendations.md)
* [Size your shards](optimize-performance/size-shards.md)
* [Tune for indexing speed](optimize-performance/indexing-speed.md)
* [Tune for search speed](optimize-performance/search-speed.md)
* [Tune approximate kNN search](optimize-performance/approximate-knn-search.md)
* [Tune for disk usage](optimize-performance/disk-usage.md)
