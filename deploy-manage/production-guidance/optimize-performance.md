# Elasticsearch performance optimizations [how-to]

Elasticsearchâ€™s default settings provide a good out-of-box experience for basic operations like full text search, highlighting, aggregations, and indexing.

However, there are a number of optimizations you can make to improve performance for your use case.

This section provides recommendations for various use cases.
