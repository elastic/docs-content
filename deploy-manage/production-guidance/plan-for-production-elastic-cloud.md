# Plan for production (Elastic Cloud)

% What needs to be done: Refine

% GitHub issue: https://github.com/elastic/docs-projects/issues/341

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud/ec-planning.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud-heroku/ech-planning.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$ech-ha$$$

$$$ec-ha$$$

$$$ec-workloads$$$

$$$ech-workloads$$$

**This page is a work in progress.** The documentation team is working to combine content pulled from the following pages:

* [/raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud/ec-planning.md](/raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud/ec-planning.md)
* [/raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud-heroku/ech-planning.md](/raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud-heroku/ech-planning.md)
