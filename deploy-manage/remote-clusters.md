# Remote clusters [remote-clusters]

By setting up **remote clusters**, you can connect an {{es}} cluster to other {{es}} clusters. Remote clusters can be located in different data centers, geographic regions, and run on a different type of environment: {{ech}}, {{ece}}, {{eck}}, or self-managed.

Remote clusters are especially useful in two cases:

- **Cross-cluster replication**
  With [cross-cluster replication](/deploy-manage/tools/cross-cluster-replication.md), or CCR, you ingest data to an index on a remote cluster. This leader index is replicated to one or more read-only follower indices on your local cluster. Creating a multi-cluster architecture with cross-cluster replication enables you to configure disaster recovery, bring data closer to your users, or establish a centralized reporting cluster to process reports locally.

- **Cross-cluster search**
  [Cross-cluster search](/solutions/search/cross-cluster-search.md), or CCS, enables you to run a search request against one or more remote clusters. This capability provides each region with a global view of all clusters, allowing you to send a search request from a local cluster and return results from all connected remote clusters. For full {{ccs}} capabilities, the local and remote cluster must be on the same [subscription level](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions).

::::{note} about terminology
In the case of remote clusters, the {{es}} cluster or deployment initiating the connection and requests is often referred to as the **local cluster**, while the {{es}} cluster or deployment receiving the requests is referred to as the **remote cluster**.

## Setup

Depending on the environment the local and remote clusters are deployed on and the security model you wish to use, the exact details needed to add a remote cluster vary but generally follow the same path:

1. **Configure trust between clusters.** In the settings of the local deployment or cluster, configure the trust security model that your remote connections will use to access the remote cluster. This step involves specifying API keys or certificates retrieved from the remote clusters.

2. **Establish the connection.** In {{kib}} on the local cluster, finalize the connection by specifying each remote cluster's details.
