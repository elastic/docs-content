# Upgrade

Upgrading to the latest version provides you access to Elastic latest features, enhancements, performance improvements, and bug fixes, many of which enable you to save your organization money, respond faster to potential threats, and improve the tools you use to investigate and analyze your data. As new versions are released, older versions reach their end of life at a regular cadence, so it’s important to ensure that your deployment is fully maintained and supported. For more information, refer to Elastic’s [Product End of Life Dates](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol).

:::{note}
Upgrading from a release candidate build, such as 9.0.0-rc1 or 9.0.0-rc2, is not supported. Pre-releases should only be used for testing in a temporary environment.
