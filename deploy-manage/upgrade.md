# Upgrade

Upgrading to the latest version provides access to the newest Elastic features, enhancements, performance improvements, and bug fixes. These updates reduce costs, speed up threat response, and improve investigative and analytical data tools. 

:::{important}
In {{stack}} 9.0.0 and beyond, Enterprise Search is unavailable. For more information, refer to [Migrating to 9.x from Enterprise Search 8.x versions](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/enterprise-search/8.18/upgrading-to-9-x.html).
:::

When Elastic releases new versions, older versions reach their end of life on a set schedule. To keep your deployment supported, stay up to date. For more information, refer to [Product End of Life Dates](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol).

:::{note}
Upgrading from a release candidate build, such as 9.0.0-rc1, is unsupported. Use pre-releases only for testing in a temporary environment.
