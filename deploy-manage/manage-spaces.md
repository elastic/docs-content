# Manage spaces

% What needs to be done: Refine

% GitHub issue: https://github.com/elastic/docs-projects/issues/348

% Scope notes: Create a new landing page including the content that is relevant for both serverless and stateful Highlight the differences in subheadings for serverless and stateful Link to solution topics on spaces

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/kibana/kibana/xpack-spaces.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/spaces.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$spaces-control-feature-visibility$$$

$$$spaces-control-user-access$$$

$$$spaces-managing$$$
