ECK provides flexible options for managing SSL certificates in your deployments, including automatic certificate generation and rotation, integration with external tools like `cert-manager`, or using your own custom certificates. Custom HTTP certificates require manual management.

ECK automatically rotates any certificates and CAs that were generated by the operator and are under its management.

For certificate management configuration options, refer to [ECK configuration flags](cloud-on-k8s://reference/eck-configuration-flags.md).
