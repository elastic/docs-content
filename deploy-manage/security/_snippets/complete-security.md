As part of your overall security strategy, you can also do the following:

* Prevent unauthorized access with [password protection and role-based access control](/deploy-manage/users-roles.md).
* Control access to dashboards and other saved objects in your UI using [Spaces](/deploy-manage/manage-spaces.md).
* Connect a local cluster to a [remote cluster](/deploy-manage/remote-clusters.md) to enable [cross-cluster replication](/deploy-manage/tools/cross-cluster-replication.md) and [cross-cluster search](/solutions/search/cross-cluster-search.md).
* Manage [API keys](/deploy-manage/api-keys.md) used for programmatic access to Elastic.
