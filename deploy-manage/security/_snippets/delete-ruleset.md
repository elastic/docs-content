If you need to remove a rule set, you must first remove any associations with deployments.

To delete a rule set with all its rules:

1. [Remove any deployment associations](/deploy-manage/security/gcp-private-service-connect-traffic-filters.md#remove-filter-deployment).
2. From the lower navigation menu, select **Traffic filters**.
3. Find the rule set you want to edit.
4. Select the **Remove** icon. The icon is inactive if there are deployments assigned to the rule set.
