Audit logging is a powerful feature that helps you monitor and track security-related events within the {{stack}}. By enabling audit logs, you can gain visibility into authentication attempts, authorization decisions, and other system activity.

Audit logging also provides forensic evidence in the event of an attack, and can be enabled independently for {{es}} and {{kib}}.
