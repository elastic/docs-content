# Secure your cluster or deployment

It's important to protect your {{es}} cluster and the data it contains. Implementing a defense in depth strategy provides multiple layers of security to help safeguard your system.

:::{include} /deploy-manage/security/_snippets/complete-security.md
:::

:::{important}
* Never run an {{es}} cluster without security enabled. This principle cannot be overstated. Running {{es}} without security leaves your cluster exposed to anyone who can send network traffic to {{es}}, permitting these individuals to download, modify, or delete any data in your cluster.
* Never try to run {{es}} as the `root` user, which would invalidate any defense strategy and permit a malicious user to do **anything** on your server. You must create a dedicated, unprivileged user to run {{es}}. By default, the `rpm`, `deb`, `docker`, and Windows packages of {{es}} contain an `elasticsearch` user with this scope.
::: 

:::{tip}
You must secure [other {{stack}} components](/deploy-manage/security/secure-clients-integrations.md), as well as [client and integration communications](/deploy-manage/security/httprest-clients-security.md), separately.
:::

You can configure the following aspects of your Elastic cluster or deployment to maintain and enhance security:

## Security activation [manually-configure-security]

% Intro to link automatic setup and manual setup process of security

Everything starts with the security feature activation in {{es}}, which enables authentication and authorization, TLS encryption of communications, and all other security related functionality described in this section.

::::{note}
Orchestrated deployments automatically configures security by default, the elastic user password, TLS certificates, and configure {{kib}} to access {{es}} in a secure way. Disabling security is not an option in managed deployments.
::::

In self-managed clusters, there are two ways to perform the initial security setup, depending on your needs:

* Automatic security setup: {{es}} security requires TLS certificates to be configured for inter-node communications (transport layer), and in order to facilitate the initial setup, there's an automatic configuration.

* Manual security setup: If you are configuring security in an unsecured cluster, or if you want to use your own certificates, you can follow the manual approach, which consists of three steps, depending whether your cluster is a single-node or multi-node cluster:
  * Minimal security
  * Basic transport TLS security: for multi-node clusters only, as single-node clusters don't need to talk with other nodes.
  * HTTP TLS: optional but highly recommended

Refer to [skipxxxx]() to understand in what cases autoconfiguration works and when a manual configuration will be expected.

Kibana also supports HTTPS.

Mutual authentication is also an option.

### Security basics (a decidir)

For {{es}} to be able to start with security enabled, the following is necessary:


single nodes and multiple-nodes.
What is required, what is optional. Single-node vs multi-node
Consider Kibana HTTPS

Security gives access to users and roles and certificates, links

Security needs vary depending on whether you’re developing locally on your laptop or securing all communications in a production environment. Regardless of where you’re deploying the {{stack}} ("ELK"), running a secure cluster is incredibly important to protect your data. That’s why security is [enabled and configured by default](../deploy/self-managed/installing-elasticsearch.md) since {{es}} 8.0.

### Minimal security ({{es}} Development) [security-minimal-overview]

::::{important}
The minimal security scenario is not sufficient for [production mode](../deploy/self-managed/bootstrap-checks.md#dev-vs-prod-mode) clusters. If your cluster has multiple nodes, you must enable minimal security and then [configure Transport Layer Security (TLS)](secure-cluster-communications.md) between nodes.
::::

If you’ve been working with {{es}} and want to enable security on your existing, unsecured cluster, start here. You’ll set passwords for the built-in users to prevent unauthorized access to your local cluster, and also configure password authentication for {{kib}}.

[Set up minimal security](set-up-minimal-security.md)

### Basic security ({{es}} + {{kib}}) [security-basic-overview]

This scenario configures TLS for communication between nodes. This security layer requires that nodes verify security certificates, which prevents unauthorized nodes from joining your {{es}} cluster.

Your external HTTP traffic between {{es}} and {{kib}} won’t be encrypted, but internode communication will be secured.

[Set up basic security](secure-cluster-communications.md)

### Basic security plus secured HTTPS traffic ({{stack}}) [security-basic-https-overview]

This scenario builds on the one for basic security and secures all HTTP traffic with TLS. In addition to configuring TLS on the transport interface of your {{es}} cluster, you configure TLS on the HTTP interface for both {{es}} and {{kib}}.

::::{note}
If you need mutual (bidirectional) TLS on the HTTP layer, then you’ll need to configure mutual authenticated encryption.
::::

You then configure {{kib}} and Beats to communicate with {{es}} using TLS so that all communications are encrypted. This level of security is strong, and ensures that any communications in and out of your cluster are secure.

## Communication and network security

## Configure security in a self-managed cluster

Since {{es}} 8.0, security is enabled and configured by default. However, security auto configuration [might be skipped](/deploy-manage/security/manually-configure-security-in-self-managed-cluster.md#stack-skip-auto-configuration) in certain scenarios. In these cases, you can [manually configure security](/deploy-manage/security/manually-configure-security-in-self-managed-cluster.md).

## FIPS 140-2 compliant mode
```{applies_to}
deployment:
  self:
  eck:
```

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140-2, (FIPS PUB 140-2), titled "Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules" is a U.S. government computer security standard used to approve cryptographic modules. You can run a self-managed cluster or {{eck}} cluster in FIPS-compliant mode:

* [Self-managed](/deploy-manage/security/fips-140-2.md)
* [ECK](/deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-on-k8s/deploy-fips-compatible-version-of-eck.md)

% we need to refine this table, but the idea is awesome IMO

### Network access

Control which systems can access your Elastic deployments and clusters through traffic filtering and network controls:

- **IP traffic filtering**: Restrict access based on IP addresses or CIDR ranges.
- **Private link filters**: Secure connectivity through AWS PrivateLink, Azure Private Link, or GCP Private Service Connect.
- **Static IPs**: Use static IP addresses for predictable firewall rules.
- **Remote cluster access**: Secure cross-cluster operations.

Refer to [](traffic-filtering.md).


### Cluster communication

- **HTTP and HTTPs**
- **TLS certificates and keys**


### Data, objects and settings security

- **Bring your own encryption key**: Use your own encryption key instead of the default encryption at rest provided by Elastic.
- **{{es}} and {{kib}} keystores**: Secure sensitive settings using keystores
- **{{kib}} saved objects**: Customize the encryption for {{kib}} objects such as dashboards.
- **{{kib}} session management**: Customize {{kib}} session expiration settings.

Refer to [](data-security.md).

### User roles

[Define roles](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/defining-roles.md) for your users and [assign appropriate privileges](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/elasticsearch-privileges.md) to ensure that users have access only to the resources that they need. This process determines whether the user behind an incoming request is allowed to run that request.
