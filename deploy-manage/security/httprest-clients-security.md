# HTTP/REST clients and security [http-clients]

The {{es}} {security-features} work with standard HTTP [basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) headers to authenticate users. Since Elasticsearch is stateless, this header must be sent with every request:

```shell
Authorization: Basic <TOKEN> <1>
```

1. The `<TOKEN>` is computed as `base64(USERNAME:PASSWORD)`


Alternatively, you can use [token-based authentication services](../users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/token-based-authentication-services.md).


## Client examples [http-clients-examples] 

This example uses `curl` without basic auth to create an index:

```shell
curl -XPUT 'localhost:9200/idx'
```

```js
{
  "error":  "AuthenticationException[Missing authentication token]",
  "status": 401
}
```

Since no user is associated with the request above, an authentication error is returned. Now weâ€™ll use `curl` with basic auth to create an index as the `rdeniro` user:

```shell
curl --user rdeniro:taxidriver -XPUT 'localhost:9200/idx'
```

```js
{
  "acknowledged": true
}
```


## Secondary authorization [http-clients-secondary-authorization] 

Some APIs support secondary authorization headers for situations where you want tasks to run with a different set of credentials. For example, you can send the following header in addition to the basic authentication header:

```shell
es-secondary-authorization: Basic <TOKEN> <1>
```

1. The `<TOKEN>` is computed as `base64(USERNAME:PASSWORD)`


The `es-secondary-authorization` header has the same syntax as the `Authorization` header. It therefore also supports the use of [token-based authentication services](../users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/token-based-authentication-services.md). For example:

```shell
es-secondary-authorization: ApiKey <TOKEN> <1>
```

1. The `<TOKEN>` is computed as `base64(API key ID:API key)`
