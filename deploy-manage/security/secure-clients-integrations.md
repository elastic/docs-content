# Secure clients and integrations [security-clients-integrations]

You will need to update the configuration for several [clients](httprest-clients-security.md) to work with a secured {{es}} cluster.

The {{es}} {{security-features}} enable you to secure your {{es}} cluster. But {{es}} itself is only one product within the {{stack}}. It is often the case that other products in the {{stack}} are connected to the cluster and therefore need to be secured as well, or at least communicate with the cluster in a secured way:
