# Secure other {{stack}} components 

The {{es}} {{security-features}} enable you to secure your {{es}} cluster. However, {{es}} itself is only one product within the {{stack}}. Other products in the {{stack}} are connected to the cluster and therefore need to be secured as well, or at least communicate with the cluster in a secured way. Review the guides for other {{es}} products:
