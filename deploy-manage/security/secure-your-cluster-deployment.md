**This page is a work in progress.** The documentation team is working to combine content pulled from the following pages:

Protecting your {{es}} cluster and the data it contains is of utmost importance. Implementing a defense in depth strategy provides multiple layers of security to help safeguard your system.

:::{important}
Never run an {{es}} cluster without security enabled. This principle cannot be overstated. Running {{es}} without security leaves your cluster exposed to anyone who can send network traffic to {{es}}, permitting these individuals to download, modify, or delete any data in your cluster.
::: 

To secure your clusters and deployments, consider the following:

## Network access

Control which systems can access your Elastic deployments and clusters through traffic filtering and network controls:

- **IP traffic filtering**: Restrict access based on IP addresses or CIDR ranges.
- **Private link filters**: Secure connectivity through AWS PrivateLink, Azure Private Link, or GCP Private Service Connect.
- **Static IPs**: Use static IP addresses for predictable firewall rules.
- **Remote cluster access**: Secure cross-cluster operations.

Refer to [](traffic-filtering.md).

## Cluster communication

- **HTTP and HTTPs**
- **TLS certificates and keys**


## Data and objects security

- **Bring your own encryption key**
- **Elasticsearch keystore**
- **Kibana saved objects**

## User roles and sessions

[Define roles](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/defining-roles.md) for your users and [assign appropriate privileges](/deploy-manage/users-roles/cluster-or-deployment-auth/elasticsearch-privileges.md) to ensure that users have access only to the resources that they need. This process determines whether the user behind an incoming request is allowed to run that request.

:::{important}
Never try to run {{es}} as the `root` user, which would invalidate any defense strategy and permit a malicious user to do **anything** on your server. You must create a dedicated, unprivileged user to run {{es}}. By default, the `rpm`, `deb`, `docker`, and Windows packages of {{es}} contain an `elasticsearch` user with this scope.
