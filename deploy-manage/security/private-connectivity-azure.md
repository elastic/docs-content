# Private connectivity with Azure Private Link

You can use Azure Private Link to establish a secure connection for your {{ecloud}} deployments to communicate with other Azure services. Azure routes the Private Link traffic within the Azure data center and never exposes it to the public internet.

Azure Private Link establishes a secure connection between two Azure VNets. The VNets can belong to separate accounts, for example a service provider and their service consumers. Azure routes the Private Link traffic within the Azure data centers and never exposes it to the public internet. In such a configuration, {{ecloud}} is the third-party service provider and the customers are service consumers.

Private Link is a connection between an Azure Private Endpoint and a Azure Private Link Service.

Azure Private Link requires that you also filter traffic to your deployments by creating virtual private connection (VPC) filters as part of your private connection policy in {{ecloud}}. This limits traffic to your deployment to the VPC specified in the policy, as well as any other filters defined in policies applied to the deployment.

To learn how private connection policies impact your deployment, refer to [](/deploy-manage/security/network-security-policies.md).

:::{tip}
{{ech}} also supports [IP filters](/deploy-manage/security/ip-filtering-cloud.md). You can apply both IP filters and private connections to a single {{ecloud}} resource.
:::

## Considerations

Private connectivity with Azure Private Link is supported only in Azure regions.

## Azure Private Link Service aliases [ec-private-link-azure-service-aliases]

Private Link Services are set up by Elastic in all supported Azure regions under the following aliases:

## Set up a private connection

The process of setting up the private connection with Azure Private link is split between Azure (e.g. by using Azure portal), and the {{ecloud}} UI. These are the high-level steps:

| Azure portal | {{ecloud}} |
| --- | --- |
| 1. [Create a private endpoint using {{ecloud}} service alias](#ec-private-link-azure-dns). |  |
| 2. [Create a DNS record pointing to the private endpoint](#ec-private-link-azure-dns). |  |
|  | 3. [Create a private connection policy](#ec-azure-allow-traffic-from-link-id). |
|  | 4. [Associate the Azure private connection policy with your deployments](#associate-private-connection-policy). |
|  | 5. [Interact with your deployments over Private Link](#ec-azure-access-the-deployment-over-private-link). |

After you create your private connection policy, you can [edit](#edit-private-connection-policy), [disassociate](#remove-private-connection-policy), or [delete](#delete-private-connection-policy) it.

### Create your private endpoint and DNS entries in Azure [ec-private-link-azure-dns]

1. Create a private endpoint in your VNet using the alias for your region.

    Follow the [Azure instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/create-private-endpoint-portal#create-a-private-endpoint) for details on creating a private endpoint to an endpoint service.

    Use [the service aliases for your region](#ec-private-link-azure-service-aliases). Select the **Connect to an Azure resource by resource ID or alias** option. For example for the region `eastus2` the service alias is `eastus2-prod-002-privatelink-service.64359fdd-7893-4215-9929-ece3287e1371.eastus2.azure.privatelinkservice`

    ::::{note}
    The Private Link endpoint is created in the `Awaiting Approval` state. We validate and approve the endpoints when you create the private connection policy using the Private Link `resource ID`, as described in the next section [Create a private connection policy](#ec-azure-allow-traffic-from-link-id).
    ::::

2. Create a DNS record.

    1. Create a private DNS zone. 
        
       Refer to the **Azure Private Link Service Alias** column in the [Azure Private Link Service aliases](#ec-private-link-azure-service-aliases) table for the name of the zone. For example, in `eastus2`, use `privatelink.eastus2.azure.elastic-cloud.com` as the zone domain name. Using this zone domain name is required to ensure certificate names match.
    2. After creating the private DNS zone, associate the zone with your VNet by creating a [virtual network link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/private-dns-getstarted-portal).
    3. Create a DNS A record pointing to the private endpoint. Use `*` as the record name, `A` as the type, and put the private endpoint IP address as the record value.

        Follow the [Azure instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/private-dns-getstarted-portal#create-an-additional-dns-record) for details on creating an A record which points to your private endpoint IP address.

        ::::{tip}
        The private endpoint IP address is available through the network interface for the private endpoint.
        ::::



## Create a private connection policy [ec-azure-allow-traffic-from-link-id]

After you create your private endpoint and DNS entries, you can create a private connection policy in {{ecloud}}.

Follow these high-level steps to add a private connection policy that can be associated with your deployments.

1. [Find your private endpoint resource name](#ec-find-your-resource-name).
2. [Find your private endpoint resource ID](#ec-find-your-resource-id).
3. [Create policies using the Private Link Endpoint resource ID](#create-private-connection-policy).
4. [Test the connection](#test-the-connection).
5. [Associate the private endpoint with your deployment](#associate-private-connection-policy).

### Find your private endpoint resource name [ec-find-your-resource-name]

1. Go to your Private Link Endpoint in the Azure Portal.
2. Select **JSON View**.
3. Copy the value of the top level **name** property.

### Find your private endpoint resource ID [ec-find-your-resource-id]

1. Go to your Private Link Endpoint in the Azure Portal.
2. Select **JSON View**.
3. Copy the value of the **properties.resourceGUID** property.

:::

:::{image} /deploy-manage/images/cloud-ec-private-link-azure-properties.png
:alt: Private endpoint properties
:screenshot:
:::


### Create a policy using the Private Link Endpoint resource [create-private-connection-policy]

When you have your private endpoint name and ID, you can create a private connection policy.

::::{note}
The Private Link connection will be approved automatically after the private connection policy is created.
::::


:::{include} _snippets/network-security-page.md
:::
4. Select **Private connection**.
5. Select the resource type that the private connection will be applied to. Currently, only hosted deployments are supported.
6.  Select the cloud provider and region for the private connection. 
   
    :::{tip}
    Private connection policies are bound to a single region, and can be assigned only to deployments in the same region. If you want to associate a policy with resources in multiple regions, then you have to create the same policy in all the regions you want to apply it to.
    :::
7.  Under **Connectivity**, select **Privatelink**.
8.  Enter your private endpoint **Resource name** and **Resource ID**. When applied to a deployment, this information will be used to filter traffic.

    :::{tip}
    You can apply multiple policies to a single deployment. The policies can be of different types. In case of multiple policies, traffic can match any associated policy to be forwarded to the resource. If none of the policies match, the request is rejected with `403 Forbidden`.

    [Learn more about how network security policies affect your deployment](network-security-policies.md).
    :::

9.  Optional: Under **Apply to resources**, associate the new private connection policy with one or more deployments. After you associate the filter with a deployment, it starts filtering traffic.
    
    :::{tip}
    Associating the private connection policy with deployments is optional. After the private connection policy is created, private connectivity is established.
    
    Associating the policy with your deployments allows you to do the following: 

    * [View a list of the resources](network-security-policies.md#protected-resources-overview) that have private connections applied.
    * Filter traffic to your deployment.
    :::

10. To automatically attach this private connection policy to new deployments, select **Apply by default**.
11.  Click **Create**.
12. Optional: You can [claim your Private Endpoint resource name and ID](/deploy-manage/security/claim-private-connection-api.md), so that no other organization is able to use it in a private connection policy.

Creating the policy approves the Private Link connection.

After the private link connection is approved, you can optionally [test the connection](#test-the-connection), and then [associate the policy](#associate-private-connection-policy) with your deployment.

### Test the connection

After you create your private connection, you can check that you're able to reach a cluster over Private Link.

:::{include} _snippets/private-url-struct.md
:::

To test the connection:

1. If needed, find the endpoint of an application in your deployment:
   
    :::{include} _snippets/find-endpoint.md
    :::

2. Test the setup using the following cURL command. Pass the username and password for a user that has access to the cluster. Make sure to replace the URL with your deployment's endpoint information and the private hosted zone domain name that you registered.

    ```sh
    $ curl -v https://my-deployment-d53192.es.privatelink.eastus2.azure.elastic-cloud.com:9243 -u {username}:{password}
    ```

    The output should look like this:

    ```sh
    * Rebuilt URL to: https://my-deployment-d53192.es.privatelink.eastus2.azure.elastic-cloud.com:9243/
    *   Trying 192.168.46.5... # note this IP address
    ..
    * SSL connection using TLS1.2 / ECDHE_RSA_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
    * 	 server certificate verification OK
    * 	 common name: *.privatelink.elastic-cloud.com (matched)
    ..
        < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    ..
    {
        "name" : "instance-0000000009",
        "cluster_name" : "fb7e805e5cfb4931bdccc4f3cb591f5f",
        "cluster_uuid" : "2cTHeCQYS2a0iH7YnQHrIQ",
        "version" : { ... },
        "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
    }
    ```

    Check the IP address `192.168.46.5` it should be the same as the IP address of your private endpoint.

    The connection is established, and a valid certificate is presented to the client. Elastic responds, in the case of the {{es}} endpoint, with basic information about the cluster.

In the event that the Private Link connection is not approved by {{ecloud}}, you’ll get an error message like the following. Double check that the filter you’ve created in the previous step uses the right resource ID.


**Request**
```sh
$ curl -v https://my-deployment-d53192.es.privatelink.eastus2.azure.elastic-cloud.com:9243 -u {username}:{password}
```

**Response**
```sh
* Rebuilt URL to: https:/my-deployment-d53192.es.privatelink.eastus2.azure.elastic-cloud.com:9243/
*   Trying 192.168.46.5...
* connect to 192.168.46.5 port 9243 failed: No route to host
* Failed to connect to my-deployment-d53192.es.privatelink.eastus2.azure.elastic-cloud.com port 9243: No route to host
* Closing connection 0
curl: (7) Failed to connect to my-deployment-d53192.es.privatelink.eastus2.azure.elastic-cloud.com port 9243: No route to host
```

### Associate a private connection policy with a deployment [associate-private-connection-policy]

You can associate a private connection policy with your deployment from the policy's settings, or from your deployment's settings. 

After you associate the policy with a deployment, it starts filtering traffic. 

:::{tip}
Associating the private connection policy with deployments is optional. After the private connection policy is created, private connectivity is established.

Associating the policy with your deployments allows you to do the following: 

* [View a list of the resources](network-security-policies.md#protected-resources-overview) that have private connections applied.
* Filter traffic to your deployment.
:::

#### From a deployment

:::{include} _snippets/associate-filter.md
:::

#### From the policy settings

:::{include} _snippets/network-security-page.md
:::
5. Find the policy you want to edit.
6. Under **Apply to resources**, associate the policy with one or more deployments.
7. Click **Update** to save your changes.

## Access the deployment over a Private Link [ec-azure-access-the-deployment-over-private-link]

For traffic to connect with the deployment over Azure Private Link, the client making the request needs to be located within the VNet where you’ve created the private endpoint. You can also setup network traffic to flow through the originating VNet from somewhere else, such as another VNet or a VPN from your corporate network. This assumes that the private endpoint and the DNS record are also available within that context. Check your service provider documentation for setup instructions.

::::{important}
Use the alias you’ve set up as CNAME A record to access your deployment.
::::

:::{include} _snippets/private-url-struct.md
:::

To access the deployment:

1. If needed, find the endpoint of an application in your deployment:
   
    :::{include} _snippets/find-endpoint.md
    :::

2. Send a request:

    **Request**
    ```sh
    $ curl -v https://my-deployment-d53192.es.privatelink.eastus2.azure.elastic-cloud.com:9243 -u {username}:{password}
    ```

    **Response**
    ```sh
    * Rebuilt URL to: https://my-deployment-d53192.es.privatelink.eastus2.azure.elastic-cloud.com:9243/
    *   Trying 192.168.46.5... 
    ..
    * SSL connection using TLS1.2 / ECDHE_RSA_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
    * 	 server certificate verification OK
    * 	 common name: *.privatelink.elastic-cloud.com (matched)
    ..
        < HTTP/1.1 200 OK

## Setting up an inter-region Private Link connection [ec-azure-inter-region-private-link]

Azure supports inter-region Private Link as described in the [Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview).

This means your deployment on {{ecloud}} can be in a different region than the Private Link endpoints or the clients that consume the deployment endpoints.

:::{image} /deploy-manage/images/cloud-ce-azure-inter-region-pl.png
:alt: Inter-region Private Link
:screenshot:
:::

1. Set up Private Link Endpoint in region 1 for a deployment hosted in region 2.

    1. Create your Private Link Endpoint using the service alias for region 2 in the region 1 VNET (let’s call this VNET1).
    2. Create a Private Hosted Zone for region 2, and associate it with VNET1 similar to the step [Create a Private Link endpoint and DNS](#ec-private-link-azure-dns). Note that you are creating these resources in region 1, VNET1.

2. [Create a private connection policy](#create-private-connection-policy) in the region where your deployment is hosted, and [associate it](#associate-private-connection-policy) with your deployment.
   
3. [Test the connection](#ec-azure-access-the-deployment-over-private-link) from a VM or client in region 1 to your Private Link endpoint, and it should be able to connect to your {{es}} cluster hosted in region 2.

## Manage private connection policies

After you create your private connection policy, you can edit it, remove it from your deployment, or delete it.

### Edit a private connection policy [edit-private-connection-policy]

You can edit a policy's name, description, VPC endpoint ID, and more.

:::{include} _snippets/network-security-page.md
:::
1. Find the policy you want to edit, then click the **Edit** {icon}`pencil` button.
2. Click **Update** to save your changes.

:::{tip}
You can also edit network security policies from your deployment's **Security** page or your project's **Network security** page.
:::

### Remove a private connection policy from your deployment [remove-private-connection-policy]

If you want to a specific policy from a deployment, or delete the policy, then you need to disconnect it from any associated deployments first. You can do this from the policy's settings, or from your deployment's settings. To remove an association through the UI:

#### From your deployment

1. Find your deployment on the home page or on the **Hosted deployments** page, then select **Manage** to access its settings menus.

    On the **Hosted deployments** page you can narrow your deployments by name, ID, or choose from several other filters. To customize your view, use a combination of filters, or change the format from a grid to a list.
2. On the **Security** page, under **Network security**, find the policy that you want to disconnect. 
3. Under **Actions**, click the **Delete** icon.

#### From the private connection policy settings

:::{include} _snippets/network-security-page.md
:::
5. Find the policy you want to edit, then click the **Edit** {icon}`pencil` button.
6. Under **Apply to resources**, click the `x` beside the resource that you want to disconnect.
7. Click **Update** to save your changes.

### Delete a private connection policy [delete-private-connection-policy]

If you need to remove a policy, you must first remove any associations with deployments.

To delete a policy:

:::{include} _snippets/network-security-page.md
:::
4. Find the policy you want to edit, then click the **Delete** button. The icon is inactive if there are deployments associated with the policy.
