# FIPS 140-2 compliance

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140-2, (FIPS PUB 140-2), titled "Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules" is a U.S. government computer security standard used to approve cryptographic modules.
- [{{es}}](/deploy-manage/security/fips-es.md) offers a FIPS 140-2 compliant mode and as such can run in a FIPS 140-2 configured JVM.
- [{{kib}}](/deploy-manage/security/fips-kib.md) offers a FIPS 140-2 compliant mode and as such can run in a Node.js environment configured with a FIPS 140-2 compliant OpenSSL3 provider.
- Some [Ingest tools](/deploy-manage/security/fips-ingest.md), including {{agent}}, {{fleet}}, {{filebeat}}, {{metricbeat}}, and {{apm-server}}, are available as FIPS compatible binaries and can be configured to use FIPS 140-2 compliant cryptography.
