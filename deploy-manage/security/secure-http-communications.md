# Secure HTTP communications

## Overview

Securing HTTP communications is essential for protecting data transmitted between:

- {{kib}} and {{es}}
- {{kib}} and web browsers
- External monitoring systems and {{es}}
- Any HTTP client and your {{stack}} deployment

Different deployment types have different requirements:

| Deployment Type | HTTP Security Configuration |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| {{ech}}/{{serverless-short}} | Automatically configured |
| Self-managed | Manual configuration required |
| {{eck}} | Configurable with defaults |
| {{ece}} | Manual configuration required |

## Self-managed deployments

```{applies_to}
self:
```

For self-managed deployments, you need to generate and configure certificates for secure HTTP communications.

### Prerequisites

Complete all steps in: 

- [Set up basic security](/deploy-manage/security/set-up-basic-security.md)
- [](/deploy-manage/security/set-up-basic-security-plus-https.md)

### Mutual TLS removed


## Securing client applications

When connecting client applications to {{es}}, use these best practices:

- Always use HTTPS for all connections
- Validate server certificates to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks
- Use API keys or token-based authentication rather than basic auth where possible
- Implement appropriate connection pooling and retry mechanisms
- Consider mutual TLS for high-security environments

For code examples and library-specific guidance, see [HTTP/REST client security](httprest-clients-security.md).

## Securing Beats connections

% TODO: Put in clients section

When sending data from Beats to Elasticsearch, you need to secure those communications with TLS and proper authentication.

Key configuration requirements:
- Configure Beats to use HTTPS when connecting to Elasticsearch
- Set up appropriate authentication (API keys recommended)
- Verify Elasticsearch server certificates

For detailed instructions on configuring Beats security settings, see [Configure Beats security](/deploy-manage/security/set-up-basic-security-plus-https.md#configure-beats-security).

## {{ece}} (ECE)

```{applies_to}
deployment:
    ece: all
```

For ECE deployments, certificate management and TLS configuration are handled at the platform level. Refer to these guides for ECE-specific security configurations:

- [Manage security certificates in ECE](secure-your-elastic-cloud-enterprise-installation/manage-security-certificates.md)
- [Allow x509 Certificates Signed with SHA-1](secure-your-elastic-cloud-enterprise-installation/allow-x509-certificates-signed-with-sha-1.md)
- [Configure TLS version](secure-your-elastic-cloud-enterprise-installation/configure-tls-version.md)

## {{eck}} (ECK) [k8s-tls-certificates]

```{applies_to}
deployment:
    eck: all
```

:::{note}
This section only covers TLS certificates for the HTTP layer. TLS certificates for the transport layer that are used for internal communications between Elasticsearch nodes are managed by ECK and cannot be changed. You can however set your own certificate authority for the [transport layer](/deploy-manage/security/k8s-transport-settings.md#k8s-transport-ca).
:::

By default, the operator manages a self-signed certificate with a custom CA for each resource. The CA, the certificate and the private key are each stored in a separate `Secret`.

```sh
> kubectl get secret | grep es-http
hulk-es-http-ca-internal         Opaque                                2      28m
hulk-es-http-certs-internal      Opaque                                2      28m
hulk-es-http-certs-public        Opaque                                1      28m
```

The public certificate is stored in a secret named `<name>-[es|kb|apm|ent|agent]-http-certs-public`.

```sh
> kubectl get secret hulk-es-http-certs-public -o go-template='{{index .data "tls.crt" | base64decode }}'
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIDQDCCAiigAwIBAgIQHC4O/RWX15a3/P3upsm3djANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFADA6
...
QLYL4zLEby3vRxq65+xofVBJAaM=
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

### Custom HTTP certificate [k8s-custom-http-certificate]

You can provide your own CA and certificates instead of the self-signed certificate to connect to Elastic stack applications through HTTPS using a Kubernetes secret.

Check [Setup your own certificate](/deploy-manage/security/secure-http-communications.md#k8s-setting-up-your-own-certificate) to learn how to do that.

#### Custom self-signed certificate using OpenSSL [k8s_custom_self_signed_certificate_using_openssl]

This example illustrates how to create your own self-signed certificate for the [quickstart Elasticsearch cluster](/deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-on-k8s/elasticsearch-deployment-quickstart.md) using the OpenSSL command line utility. Note the subject alternative name (SAN) entry for `quickstart-es-http.default.svc`.

```sh
$ openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -newkey rsa:4096 -days 365 -subj "/CN=quickstart-es-http" -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:quickstart-es-http.default.svc" -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt
$ kubectl create secret generic quickstart-es-cert --from-file=ca.crt=tls.crt --from-file=tls.crt=tls.crt --from-file=tls.key=tls.key
```

#### Custom self-signed certificate using cert-manager [k8s_custom_self_signed_certificate_using_cert_manager]

This example illustrates how to issue a self-signed certificate for the [quickstart Elasticsearch cluster](/deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-on-k8s/elasticsearch-deployment-quickstart.md) using a [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io) self-signed issuer.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: selfsigned-issuer
spec:
  selfSigned: {}
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: quickstart-es-cert
spec:
  isCA: true
  dnsNames:
    - quickstart-es-http
    - quickstart-es-http.default.svc
    - quickstart-es-http.default.svc.cluster.local
  issuerRef:
    kind: Issuer
    name: selfsigned-issuer
  secretName: quickstart-es-cert
  subject:
    organizations:
      - quickstart
```

Here is how to issue multiple Elasticsearch certificates from a single self-signed CA. This is useful for example for [Remote clusters](/deploy-manage/remote-clusters/eck-remote-clusters.md) which need to trust each otherâ€™s CA, in order to avoid mounting N CAs when a cluster is connected to N other clusters.

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: selfsigned-issuer
spec:
  selfSigned: {}
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: selfsigned-ca
spec:
  isCA: true
  commonName: selfsigned-ca
  secretName: root-ca-secret
  privateKey:
    algorithm: ECDSA
    size: 256
  issuerRef:
    kind: ClusterIssuer
    name: selfsigned-issuer
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: ca-issuer
spec:
  ca:
    secretName: root-ca-secret
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: quickstart-es-cert
spec:
  isCA: false
  dnsNames:
    - quickstart-es-http
    - quickstart-es-http.default.svc
    - quickstart-es-http.default.svc.cluster.local
  subject:
    organizations:
      - quickstart
  privateKey:
    algorithm: RSA
    encoding: PKCS1
    size: 2048
  issuerRef:
    kind: Issuer
    name: ca-issuer
  secretName: quickstart-es-cert
```

### Reserve static IP and custom domain [k8s-static-ip-custom-domain]

To use a custom domain with a self-signed certificate:

```yaml
spec:
  http:
    service:
      spec:
        type: LoadBalancer
    tls:
      selfSignedCertificate:
        subjectAltNames:
        - ip: 160.46.176.15
        - dns: hulk.example.com
```

### Setup your own certificate [k8s-setting-up-your-own-certificate]

You can bring your own certificate to configure TLS to ensure that communication between HTTP clients and the Elastic Stack application is encrypted.

Create a Kubernetes secret with:

* `ca.crt`: CA certificate (optional if `tls.crt` was issued by a well-known CA).
* `tls.crt`: The certificate.
* `tls.key`: The private key to the first certificate in the certificate chain.

::::{warning} 
If your `tls.crt` is signed by an intermediate CA you may need both the Root CA and the intermediate CA combined within the `ca.crt` file depending on whether the Root CA is globally trusted.
::::

```sh
kubectl create secret generic my-cert --from-file=ca.crt --from-file=tls.crt --from-file=tls.key
```

Alternatively you can also bring your own CA certificate including a private key and let ECK issue certificates with it. Any certificate SANs you have configured as decribed in [Reserve static IP and custom domain](#k8s-static-ip-custom-domain) will also be respected when issuing certificates with this CA certificate.

Create a Kubernetes secret with:

* `ca.crt`: CA certificate.
* `ca.key`: The private key to the CA certificate.

```sh
kubectl create secret generic my-cert --from-file=ca.crt --from-file=ca.key
```

In both cases, you have to reference the secret name in the `http.tls.certificate` section of the resource manifest.

```yaml
spec:
  http:
    tls:
      certificate:
        secretName: my-cert
```

### Disable TLS [k8s-disable-tls]

You can explicitly disable TLS for Kibana, APM Server, and the HTTP layer of Elasticsearch.

```yaml
spec:
  http:
    tls:
      selfSignedCertificate:
        disabled: true
```

### Kibana HTTP configuration in ECK [k8s-kibana-http-configuration]

#### Load balancer settings and TLS SANs [k8s-kibana-http-publish]

By default a `ClusterIP` [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) is created and associated with the {{kib}} deployment. If you want to expose {{kib}} externally with a [load balancer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer), it is recommended to include a custom DNS name or IP in the self-generated certificate.

```yaml
apiVersion: kibana.k8s.elastic.co/v1
kind: Kibana
metadata:
  name: kibana-sample
spec:
  version: 8.16.1
  count: 1
  elasticsearchRef:
    name: "elasticsearch-sample"
  http:
    service:
      spec:
        type: LoadBalancer # default is ClusterIP
    tls:
      selfSignedCertificate:
        subjectAltNames:
        - ip: 1.2.3.4
        - dns: kibana.example.com
```


#### Provide your own certificate [k8s-kibana-http-custom-tls]

If you want to use your own certificate, the required configuration is identical to {{es}}. Refer to [Set up HTTPS for the Elastic Stack](/deploy-manage/security/set-up-basic-security-plus-https.md#encrypt-http-communication).

#### Disable TLS [k8s-kibana-http-disable-tls]

You can disable the generation of the self-signed certificate and hence [disable TLS](/deploy-manage/security/secure-your-cluster-deployment.md). This is not recommended outside of testing clusters.

```yaml
apiVersion: kibana.k8s.elastic.co/v1
kind: Kibana
metadata:
  name: kibana-sample
spec:
  version: 8.16.1
  count: 1
  elasticsearchRef:
    name: "elasticsearch-sample"
  http:
    tls:
      selfSignedCertificate:
        disabled: true
```
