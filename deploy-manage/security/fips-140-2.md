# FIPS 140-2 compliance

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140-2, (FIPS PUB 140-2), titled "Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules" is a U.S. government computer security standard used to approve cryptographic modules.
- [{{es}}](#fips-elasticsearch) offers a FIPS 140-2 compliant mode and as such can run in a FIPS 140-2 configured JVM.
- [{{kib}}](#fips-kibana) offers a FIPS 140-2 compliant mode and as such can run in a Node.js environment configured with a FIPS 140-2 compliant OpenSSL3 provider.

:::{note}
If you are running {{es}} through {{eck}}, refer to [ECK FIPS compatibility](/deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-on-k8s/deploy-fips-compatible-version-of-eck.md).
