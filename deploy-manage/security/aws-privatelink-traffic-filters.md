# AWS PrivateLink traffic filters

Traffic filtering to only AWS PrivateLink connections is one of the security layers available in {{ech}}. It allows you to limit how your deployments can be accessed.

Refer to [](/deploy-manage/security/traffic-filtering.md) to learn more about traffic filtering in {{ech}}, and how traffic filter rules work.

AWS PrivateLink establishes a secure connection between two AWS Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs). The VPCs can belong to separate accounts, i.e. a service provider and its service consumers. AWS routes the PrivateLink traffic within the AWS data center and never exposes it to the public internet. In such a configuration, {{ecloud}} is the third-party service provider and the customers are service consumers.

PrivateLink is a connection between a VPC Endpoint and a PrivateLink Service.

Read more about [Traffic Filtering](/deploy-manage/security/traffic-filtering.md) for the general concepts behind traffic filtering in {{ecloud}}.


## Considerations

Before you begin, review  the following considerations:

### PrivateLink filtering and regions

AWS PrivateLink filtering is supported only for AWS regions. Elastic does not yet support cross-region AWS PrivateLink connections. Your PrivateLink endpoint needs to be in the same region as your target deployments. Additional details can be found in the [AWS VPCE Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-interface.html#vpce-interface-limitations).

AWS interface VPC endpoints are configured for one or more availability zones (AZ). In some regions, our VPC endpoint *service* is not present in all the possible AZs that a region offers. You can only choose AZs that are common on both sides. As the *names* of AZs (for example `us-east-1a`) differ between AWS accounts, the following list of AWS regions shows the *ID* (e.g. `use1-az4`) of each available AZ for the service.

Check [interface endpoint availability zone considerations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-interface.html#vpce-interface-availability-zones) for more details.

### Availability zones

Elastic [charges](/deploy-manage/cloud-organization/billing/cloud-hosted-deployment-billing-dimensions.md) for inter-node traffic regardless of whether nodes are in the same or different availability zones (AZ). As a result, placing the deployment nodes within a single AZ, instead of two or three, does not reduce inter-node costs.

On the customer VPC side, the inter-availability zone data transfer, within the same AWS region, towards AWS PrivateLink endpoints, [is free of charge](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/04/aws-data-transfer-price-reduction-privatelink-transit-gateway-client-vpn-services/). As a result, you do not incur charges for cross-AZ data transfer within your VPC when the target is the AWS Privatelink {{ecloud}} service endpoint. We recommend you set up the VPC endpoints in all supported {{ecloud}} AZs for a particular region for maximum traffic throughput and resiliency.

If Elastic and your VPC overlap in two AZs or less, you can create subnets and VPC PrivateLink endpoints in your VPC within the same availability zones where Elastic PrivateLink service has presence.

### Transport client

Transport client is not supported over PrivateLink connections.

## PrivateLink service names and aliases [ec-private-link-service-names-aliases]

PrivateLink Service is set up by Elastic in all supported AWS regions under the following service names:

The process of setting up the PrivateLink connection to your clusters is split between AWS (e.g. by using AWS console) and {{ecloud}} UI. These are the high-level steps:

| AWS console | {{ecloud}} |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Create a VPC endpoint using {{ecloud}} service name. |  |
| 2. Create a DNS record pointing to the VPC endpoint. |  |
|  | 3. Create a PrivateLink rule set with your VPC endpoint ID. |
|  | 4. Associate the PrivateLink rule set with your deployments. |
|  | 5. Interact with your deployments over PrivateLink. |


## Ensure your VPC is in all availability zones [ec-aws-vpc-overlapping-azs]

Ensure your VPC endpoint is in all availability zones supported by {{ecloud}} on the region for the VPC service.

Ensuring that your VPC is in all supported {{ecloud}} availability zones for a particular region avoids potential for a traffic imbalance. That imbalance may saturate some coordinating nodes and underutilize others in the deployment, eventually impacting performance. Enabling all supported {{ecloud}} zones ensures that traffic is balanced optimally.


You can find the zone name to zone ID mapping with AWS CLI:

```sh
$ aws ec2 describe-availability-zones --region us-east-1 | jq -c '.AvailabilityZones[] | { id: .ZoneId, name: .ZoneName } ' | sort
{"id":"use1-az1","name":"us-east-1c"}
{"id":"use1-az2","name":"us-east-1e"}
{"id":"use1-az3","name":"us-east-1d"}
{"id":"use1-az4","name":"us-east-1a"}
{"id":"use1-az5","name":"us-east-1f"}
{"id":"use1-az6","name":"us-east-1b"}
```

The mapping will be different for your region. Our production VPC Service for `us-east-1` is located in `use1-az2`, `use1-az4`, `use1-az6`. We need to create the VPC Endpoint for the preceding mapping in at least one of `us-east-1e`, `us-east-1a`, `us-east-1b`.


## Create your VPC endpoint and DNS entries in AWS [ec-aws-vpc-dns]

1. Create a VPC endpoint in your VPC using the service name for your region.

    Follow the [AWS instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-interface.html#create-interface-endpoint) for details on creating a VPC interface endpoint to an endpoint service.

    Use [the service name for your region](/deploy-manage/security/aws-privatelink-traffic-filters.md#ec-private-link-service-names-aliases).

    :::{image} /deploy-manage/images/cloud-ec-private-link-service.png
    :alt: PrivateLink
    :screenshot:
    :::

    The security group for the endpoint should at minimum allow for inbound connectivity from your instances CIDR range on ports 443 and 9243. Security groups for the instances should allow for outbound connectivity to the endpoint on ports 443 and 9243.

2. Create a DNS record.

    1. Create a *Private hosted zone*. Consult  *Private hosted zone domain name* in *PrivateLink service names and aliases* for the name of the zone. For example, in *us-east-1* use `vpce.us-east-1.aws.elastic-cloud.com` as the zone domain name. Don’t forget to associate the zone with your VPC.

        :::{image} /deploy-manage/images/cloud-ec-private-link-private-hosted-zone-example.png
        :alt: Private hosted zone example
        :screenshot:
        :::

    2. Then create a DNS CNAME alias pointing to the PrivateLink Endpoint. Add the record to a private DNS zone in your VPC. Use `*` as the record name, and the VPC endpoint DNS name as a value.

        Follow the [AWS instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-creating.html) for details on creating a CNAME record which points to your VPC endpoint DNS name.

        :::{image} /deploy-manage/images/cloud-ec-private-link-cname.png
        :alt: PrivateLink CNAME
        :screenshot:
        :::

3. Test the connection.

    Find out the endpoint of your deployment. You can do that by selecting **Copy endpoint** in the Cloud UI. It looks something like:

    ```
    my-deployment-d53192.es.us-east-1.aws.found.io
    ```

    where `my-deployment-d53192` is an alias, and `es` is the product you want to access within your deployment.

    To access your {{es}} cluster over PrivateLink:

    * If you have a [custom endpoint alias](/deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/custom-endpoint-aliases.md) configured, you can use the custom endpoint URL to connect.
    * Alternatively, use the following URL structure:

        ```
        https://{{alias}}.{product}.{{private_hosted_zone_domain_name}}
        ```

        For example:

        ```text
        https://my-deployment-d53192.es.vpce.us-east-1.aws.elastic-cloud.com
        ```


    ::::{tip}
    You can use either 443, or 9243 as a port.
    ::::


    You can test the AWS console part of the setup with a following curl (substitute the region and {{es}} ID with your cluster):

    Request:
    ```sh
    $ curl -v https://my-deployment-d53192.es.vpce.us-east-1.aws.elastic-cloud.com
    ```
    Response:
    ```sh
    * Server certificate:
    *  subject: CN=*.us-east-1.aws.elastic-cloud.com
    *  SSL certificate verify ok.
    ..
    {"ok":false,"message":"Forbidden"}
    * Connection #0 to host my-deployment-d53192.es.vpce.us-east-1.aws.elastic-cloud.com left intact
    ```

    The connection is established, and a valid certificate is presented to the client. The `403 Forbidden` is expected, because you haven’t allowed the traffic over this PrivateLink connection yet.



## Add the private link rules to your deployments [ec-add-vpc-elastic]

Follow these high-level steps to add private link rules to your deployments.

1. [Find your VPC endpoint ID](/deploy-manage/security/aws-privatelink-traffic-filters.md#ec-find-your-endpoint).
2. [Create rules using the VPC endpoint](/deploy-manage/security/aws-privatelink-traffic-filters.md#ec-create-traffic-filter-private-link-rule-set).
3. [Associate the VPC endpoint with your deployment](/deploy-manage/security/aws-privatelink-traffic-filters.md#ec-associate-traffic-filter-private-link-rule-set).
4. [Access the deployment over a private link](/deploy-manage/security/aws-privatelink-traffic-filters.md#ec-access-the-deployment-over-private-link).


### Find your VPC endpoint ID [ec-find-your-endpoint]

You can find your VPC endpoint ID in the AWS console:

:::{image} /deploy-manage/images/cloud-ec-private-link-endpoint-id.png
:alt: VPC Endpoint ID
:screenshot:
:::


### Create rules with the VPC endpoint [ec-create-traffic-filter-private-link-rule-set]

Once you know your VPC endpoint ID you can create a private link traffic filter rule set.


:::{include} _snippets/create-filter.md
:::
1. Select **Private link endpoint**.
2. Create your rule set, providing a meaningful name and description.
3. Select the region for the rule set.
4. Enter your VPC endpoint ID.
5. Select if this rule set should be automatically attached to new deployments.

    ::::{note}
    Each rule set is bound to a particular region and can be only assigned to deployments in the same region.
    ::::

6.  (Optional) You can [claim your VPC endpoint ID](/deploy-manage/security/claim-traffic-filter-link-id-ownership-through-api.md), so that no other organization is able to use it in a traffic filter ruleset.

The next step is to [associate the rule set](/deploy-manage/security/aws-privatelink-traffic-filters.md#ec-associate-traffic-filter-private-link-rule-set) with your deployments.


### Associate a PrivateLink rule set with your deployment [ec-associate-traffic-filter-private-link-rule-set]

To associate a private link rule set with your deployment:

:::{include} _snippets/associate-filter.md
:::

### Access the deployment over a PrivateLink [ec-access-the-deployment-over-private-link]

For traffic to connect with the deployment over a PrivateLink, the client making the request needs to be located within the VPC where you’ve created the VPC endpoint. You can also setup network traffic to flow through the originating VPC from somewhere else, such as another VPC or VPN from your corporate network. This assumes that the VPC endpoint and the DNS record are also available within that context. Check your service provider documentation for setup instructions.

::::{important}
Use the alias you’ve set up as CNAME DNS record to access your deployment.
::::


If your deployment alias is `my-deployment-12ab9b` and it is located in `us-east-1` region you can access it at the following URL:

```
https://my-deployment-12ab9b.es.vpce.us-east-1.aws.elastic-cloud.com
```

Request:
```sh
$ curl -u 'username:password' -v https://my-deployment-d53192.es.vpce.us-east-1.aws.elastic-cloud.com
```

Response:
```
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
..
```

::::{note}
If you are using AWS PrivateLink together with Fleet, and enrolling the Elastic Agent with a PrivateLink URL, you need to configure Fleet Server to use and propagate the PrivateLink URL by updating the **Fleet Server hosts** field in the **Fleet settings** section of {{kib}}. Otherwise, Elastic Agent will reset to use a default address instead of the PrivateLink URL. The URL needs to follow this pattern: `https://<Fleet component ID/deployment alias>.fleet.<Private hosted zone domain name>:443`.

Similarly, the {{es}} host needs to be updated to propagate the Privatelink URL. The {{es}} URL needs to follow this pattern: `https://<Elasticsearch cluster ID/deployment alias>.es.<Private hosted zone domain name>:443`.

The settings `xpack.fleet.agents.fleet_server.hosts` and `xpack.fleet.outputs` that are needed to enable this configuration in {{kib}} are currently available on-prem only, and not in the [{{kib}} settings in {{ecloud}}](/deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/edit-stack-settings.md).
