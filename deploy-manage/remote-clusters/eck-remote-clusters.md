# Remote clusters on {{eck}} [k8s-remote-clusters]

::::{include} _snippets/eck_rcs_intro.md
::::

When using remote cluster connections with ECK, the setup process depends on where the remote cluster is deployed.

::::{include} _snippets/terminology.md
::::



TBD, expand a bit the intro, explaining how the orchestrator helps in some use cases depending on the local and remote.

Links to use cases and configuration guides:
* Connect to {{es}} clusters in the same ECK environment
* Connect to external {{es}} clusters
* Connect from external {{es}} clusters

(+ prereqs? + security models? )
