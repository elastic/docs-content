# Remote clusters on {{ech}} [ec-enable-ccs]

You can configure an {{ech}} deployment to either connect to remote clusters or accept connections from:

* Another {{ech}} deployment of your {{ecloud}} organization, across any region or cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azureâ€¦)
* An {{ech}} deployment of another {{ecloud}} organization
* A deployment in an {{ece}} installation
* A deployment in an {{eck}} installation
* A self-managed installation.

::::{note}
Refer to [Remote clusters and network security](/deploy-manage/remote-clusters.md#network-security) for details on how remote clusters interact with network security policies and the implications for your deployments.

## Prerequisites [ec-ccs-ccr-prerequisites]

To use CCS or CCR, your deployments must meet the following criteria:

* The local and remote clusters must run on compatible versions of {{es}}. Review the version compatibility table.
  
  :::{include} _snippets/remote-cluster-certificate-compatibility.md
  :::

* If your deployment was created before February 2021, the **Remote clusters** page in {{kib}} must be enabled manually from the **Security** page of your deployment, by selecting **Enable CCR** under **Trust management**.

## Set up remote clusters with {{ech}}

The steps, information, and authentication method required to configure CCS and CCR can vary depending on where the clusters you want to use as remote are hosted.

* Connect remotely to other clusters from your {{ech}} deployments

    * [Access other deployments of the same {{ecloud}} organization](ec-remote-cluster-same-ess.md)
    * [Access deployments of a different {{ecloud}} organization](ec-remote-cluster-other-ess.md)
    * [Access deployments of an {{ECE}} environment](ec-remote-cluster-ece.md)
    * [Access clusters of a self-managed environment](ec-remote-cluster-self-managed.md)
    * [Access deployments of an ECK environment](ec-enable-ccs-for-eck.md)

* Use clusters from your {{ech}} deployments as remote

    * [From another deployment of your {{ecloud}} organization](ec-remote-cluster-same-ess.md)
    * [From a deployment of another {{ecloud}} organization](ec-remote-cluster-other-ess.md)
    * [From an ECE deployment](ece-remote-cluster-ece-ess.md)
    * [From a self-managed cluster](remote-clusters-self-managed.md)
    * [From an ECK environment](ec-enable-ccs-for-eck.md)

## Remote clusters and network security [ec-ccs-ccr-network-security]

If you have [network security policies] applied to your deployment, then you might need to take extra steps to allow a cluster to make requests to your cluster.  Some remote cluster configurations are not compatible with network security, including incoming connections from {{eck}} and self-managed clusters. To learn more, refer to [Remote clusters and network security](/deploy-manage/remote-clusters.md#network-security).
