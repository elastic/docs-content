The [remote clusters feature](/deploy-manage/remote-clusters.md) in {{es}} enables you to establish uni-directional connections to a remote cluster. This functionality is used in [{{ccr}} ({{ccr-init}})](/deploy-manage/tools/cross-cluster-replication/set-up-cross-cluster-replication.md) and [{{ccs}} ({{ccs-init}})](/solutions/search/cross-cluster-search.md).
