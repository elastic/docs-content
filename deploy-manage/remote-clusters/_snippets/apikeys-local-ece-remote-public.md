1. [Log into the Cloud UI](/deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-enterprise/log-into-cloud-ui.md).
2. On the **Deployments** page, select your deployment.

    Narrow the list by name, ID, or choose from several other filters. To further define the list, use a combination of filters.

3. From the deployment menu, select **Security**.
4. Locate **Remote Connections > Trust management > Connections using API keys** and select **Add API key**.

    1. Fill both fields.

        * For the **Remote cluster name**, enter the the alias of your choice. You will use this alias to connect to the remote cluster later. It must be lowercase and only contain letters, numbers, dashes and underscores.
        * For the **Cross-cluster API key**, paste the encoded cross-cluster API key.

    2. Click **Add** to save the API key to the keystore.

5. Restart the local deployment to reload the keystore with its new setting. To do that, go to the deployment's main page (named after your deployment's name), locate the **Actions** menu, and select **Restart {{es}}**.<br>

    ::::{note}
    If the local deployment runs on version 8.14 or greater, you no longer need to perform this step because the keystore is reloaded automatically with the new API keys.

If you need to update the remote connection with different permissions later, refer to [Change a cross-cluster API key used for a remote connection](/deploy-manage/remote-clusters/ece-edit-remove-trusted-environment.md#ece-edit-remove-trusted-environment-api-key).
