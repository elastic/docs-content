1. Go to the **Remote Clusters** management page in the navigation menu or use the [global search field](/explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).
2. Select **Add a remote cluster**.
2. In **Select connection type**, choose the authentication mechanism you prepared earlier (**API keys** or **Certificates**), and click **Next**.

3. In **Add connection information**, fill in the following fields:

    * **Remote cluster name**: This *cluster alias* is a unique identifier that represents the connection to the remote cluster and is used to distinguish local and remote indices.

      When using API key authentication, this alias must match the **Remote cluster name** you configured when adding the API key in the Cloud UI.
    * **Remote address**: Enter the endpoint of the remote self-managed cluster,  including the hostname, FQDN, or IP address, and the port.

      Make sure you use the correct port for your authentication method:
      * **API keys**: Use the port configured in the remote cluster interface of the remote cluster (defaults to `9443`).  
      * **TLS Certificates**: Use the {{es}} transport port (defaults to `9300`).

      Starting with {{kib}} 9.2, this field also supports IPv6 addresses. When using an IPv6 address, enclose it in square brackets followed by the port number. For example: `[2001:db8::1]:9443`.

    * **Configure advanced options** (optional): Expand this section if you need to customize additional settings.
      * **TLS server name**: Specify a value if the certificate presented by the remote cluster is signed for a different name than the remote address.
      * **Socket connections**: Define the number of connections to open with the remote cluster.

    For a full list of available client connection settings, refer to [remote cluster settings reference](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/configuration-reference/remote-clusters.md#remote-cluster-proxy-settings).

4. Click **Next**.
5. In **Confirm setup**, click **Add remote cluster** (you have already established trust in a previous step).
