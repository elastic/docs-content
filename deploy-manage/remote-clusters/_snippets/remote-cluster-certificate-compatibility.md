:::::{dropdown} Version compatibility table

* Any node can communicate with another node on the same major version. For example, 9.0 can talk to any 9.x node.
* Version compatibility is symmetric, meaning that if 7.16 can communicate with 8.0, 8.0 can also communicate with 7.16. The following table depicts version compatibility between local and remote nodes.
