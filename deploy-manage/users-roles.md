# Manage users and roles [project-settings-access]


Go to **Project settings**, then ** Management** to manage your indices, data views, saved objects, settings, and more. You can also open Management by using the [global search field](../explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).

Access to individual features is governed by Elastic user roles. Consult your administrator if you do not have the appropriate access. To learn more about roles, refer to [Assign user roles and privileges](users-roles/cloud-organization/manage-users.md#general-assign-user-roles).
