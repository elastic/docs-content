# Retrieve auto-follow patterns [ccr-auto-follow-retrieve]

To view existing auto-follow patterns and make changes to the backing patterns, [access {{kib}}](manage-auto-follow-patterns.md#ccr-access-ccr-auto-follow) on your *remote* cluster.

Select the auto-follow pattern that you want to view details about. From there, you can make changes to the auto-follow pattern. You can also view your follower indices included in the auto-follow pattern.

Use the [get auto-follow pattern API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-ccr-get-auto-follow-pattern-1) to inspect all configured auto-follow pattern collections.
