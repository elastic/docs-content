# Pause and resume replication [ccr-pause-replication]

To pause and resume replication of the leader index, [access Cross-Cluster Replication](manage-cross-cluster-replication.md#ccr-access-ccr) and choose the **Follower indices** tab.

Select the follower index you want to pause and choose **Manage > Pause Replication**. The follower index status changes to Paused.

To resume replication, select the follower index and choose **Resume replication**.

::::{dropdown} API example
You can pause replication with the [pause follower API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-ccr-pause-follow) and then later resume replication with the [resume follower API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-ccr-resume-follow). Using these APIs in tandem enables you to adjust the read and write parameters on the follower shard task if your initial configuration is not suitable for your use case.
