# Failback when clusterA comes back [_failback_when_clustera_comes_back_2]

1. You can simulate this by turning `cluster A` back on.
2. Data ingested to `cluster B` during `cluster A` 's downtime will be automatically replicated.

    * data streams on cluster A

        * 150 documents in `logs-generic-default-replicated_from_clusterb`
        * 50 documents in `logs-generic-default`

    * data streams on cluster B

        * 50 documents in `logs-generic-default-replicated_from_clustera`
        * 150 documents in `logs-generic-default`

3. If you have {{ls}} running at this time, you will also observe traffic is sent to both clusters.
