# Configure a snapshot repository using Azure Blob storage [ec-azure-snapshotting]

Configure a custom snapshot repository using your Azure Blob storage account.


## Prepare a container [ec-prepare-azure-container]

Follow the Microsoft documentation to [set up an Azure storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create) with an access key, and then [create a container](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal).


## Configure the keystore [ec-configure-azure-keystore]

Create an entry for the Azure client in the {{es}} keystore:

1. Log in to the [{{ecloud}} Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
2. Navigate to the **Security** page of the deployment you wish to configure.
3. Locate **{{es}} keystore** and select **Add settings**.
4. With **Type** set to **Single string**, add the following keys and their values:

    * `azure.client.secondary.account`
    * `azure.client.secondary.key`

5. Select **Save**.

## Create the repository [ec-create-azure-repository]

1. Open {{kib}} and go to **Management** > **Snapshot and Restore**.
2. On the **Repositories** tab, select **Register a repository**.
3. Provide a name for your repository and select type **Azure**.
4. Provide the following settings:

    * Client: `secondary`

        * You can also use `default`, but we recommend using `secondary` to ensure that your secure settings are mapped to the correct repository definition.

    * Container: The name of your Azure container
    * base_path: A directory to contain the snapshots

        * This setting is optional. Include a `base_path` if you have multiple clusters writing to the same Azure repository. This ensures that a snapshot wonâ€™t overwrite the snapshot metadata for another cluster.

5. Add any other settings that you wish to configure.
6. Select Register.
7. Select **Verify** to confirm that your settings are correct and the deployment can connect to your repository.

Your snapshot repository is now set up using Azure Blob storage! You can use {{kib}} to manage your snapshots and begin sending {{es}} snapshots to your own container. For details, check the [Snapshot and Restore](create-snapshots.md) documentation.
