# Access isolation for the found-snapshots repository [ec-snapshot-repository-migration]

::::{note} 
The guides in this section are only relevant for some deployments. Any newly created deployment will have access isolation set up by default. If a deploymentâ€™s repository can be updated, a notification will show up in the deployments menu under **Elasticsearch** > **Snapshots**.
