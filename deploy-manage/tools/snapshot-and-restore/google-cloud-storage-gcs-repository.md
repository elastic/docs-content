# Google Cloud Storage (GCS) repository [ece-configure-gcp-snapshotting]

Snapshots to GCS are supported using an [advanced repository configuration](cloud-enterprise.md#ece-manage-repositories-add) and service account credentials that can administer your GCS bucket.


## Set up your service account credentials [ece_set_up_your_service_account_credentials]

Youâ€™ll need to have an existing Google Cloud account and have the appropriate permissions to generate credentials:

1. Create [service account credentials](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys) in your Google Cloud project where Elastic Cloud Enterprise is running.

    The service account should be [granted the role of `storage.admin`](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts) so that Elasticsearch clusters can read, write, and list the bucket objects.

2. Save the service account key in JSON file format. You are going to use it later to configure your Elasticsearch deployment for snapshotting.


## Add the GCS repository [ece_add_the_gcs_repository]

Add your Google Cloud Storage bucket as a repository to the platform:

1. [Log into the Cloud UI](../../deploy/cloud-enterprise/log-into-cloud-ui.md).
2. Go to **Platform > Repositories** and add the following snapshot repository configuration under the advanced mode:

    Repository GCS (check: [supported settings](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/repository-gcs.html#repository-gcs-repository))

    ```json
    {
      "type": "gcs",
      "settings": {
        "bucket": "acme-snapshot-repo",
        "bucket": "acme-snapshots"
      }
    }
    ```


Snapshots are stored in the bucket you provide. Use the repository name you define here to configure your Elasticsearch clusters for snapshotting to this repository.


## Configure your deployment for GCS snapshots [ece_configure_your_deployment_for_gcs_snapshots]

To save deployment snapshots to the custom GCS repository:

1. Add a [secure setting](../../security/secure-settings.md) named `gcs.client.acme-snapshots.credentials_file` as a JSON block. Make sure that the client name is the same one you provided when configuring the snapshot repository.

    :alt: GCS client secret configuration
    :::

    ::::{note}
    The contents within *credentials_file* must be the exact contents of your GCS credentials file.
    ::::

2. Configure your deployment to [snapshot to the GCS repository](cloud-enterprise.md).

After you enable snapshots, snapshotting will begin within 30 minutes (the default snapshot interval).
