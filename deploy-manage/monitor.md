# Monitoring

% What needs to be done: Write from scratch

% GitHub issue: https://github.com/elastic/docs-projects/issues/350

% Scope notes: one link left for redirection purposes. we have to write an introduction to this big section about Monitoring and Logging. Explain what is monitoring about (metrics and logs) and how orchestrators can help by automatically setting up the beats or monitoring agents.

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/monitor-elasticsearch-cluster.md
%      Notes: Existing articles about monitoring: Elasticsearch, Cloud, Cloud-enterprise, Cloud on Kubernetes, Kibana books Might need a new landing page
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/secure-monitoring.md
