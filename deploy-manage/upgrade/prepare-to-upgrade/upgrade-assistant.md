# Upgrade Assistant [upgrade-assistant]

The Upgrade Assistant helps you [prepare to upgrade](/deploy-manage/upgrade/prepare-to-upgrade.md) to the next version of the {{stack}}. To access the assistant, go to **{{stack-manage-app}} â†’ Upgrade Assistant**.

The assistant identifies deprecated settings in your configuration, and if any of those settings are enabled, it guides you through resolving issues that could prevent a successful upgrade. The Upgrade Assistant also helps resolve issues with older indices created before version 8.0.0, providing options to reindex older indices or mark them as read-only. 

## Required permissions [_required_permissions_11] 

To access the Upgrade Assistant, you need the `manage` cluster privilege. You may also need additional privileges to perform specific actions.


## Feature set [_feature_set] 

Some features of the Upgrade Assistant are only needed when upgrading to a new major version. The features enabled by default are those for the next version from the one {{kib}} currently runs on.

## Deprecations [_deprecations] 

The Upgrade Assistant pulls information about deprecations from the following sources:

* {{es}} deprecation info API
* {{es}} deprecation logs
* {{kib}} deprecations API

For more information about Upgrade Assistant APIs, refer to [Upgrade Assistant APIs](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/kibana/group/endpoint-upgrade).
