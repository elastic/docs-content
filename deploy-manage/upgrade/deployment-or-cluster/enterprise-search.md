# Upgrade to Enterprise Search

In {{stack}} 9.0.0 and beyond, Enterprise Search is unavailable. We recommend migrating to {{es}} for improved performance, scalability, and flexibility. For information about what {{es}} features you can use, check out this [blog post](https://www.elastic.co/blog/app-search-to-elasticsearch). 

For complete information about resources and initiatives related to App Search migrations, future enhancements, and decommissioning, refer to [Migrating to 9.x from Enterprise Search 8.x versions](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/enterprise-search/8.18/upgrading-to-9-x.html).
