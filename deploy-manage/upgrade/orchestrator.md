# Upgrade your orchestrator

:::{note}
The topics in this section apply to customers running the {{stack}} on {{ece}} (ECE) or {{eck}} (ECK). 
:::

Elastic provides customers with two major self-managed orchestrators to manage the {{stack}}. Before upgrading the products in the stack, ensure your orchestrator is running a compatible version. If you’re running a version of your orchestrator that’s incompatible with the {{stack}} version you’re upgrading to, upgrade the orchestrator first. 

Refer to one of these topics, depending on which orchestrator you have: 

* [Upgrade ECE](/deploy-manage/upgrade/orchestrator/upgrade-cloud-enterprise.md)
* [Upgrade ECK](/deploy-manage/upgrade/orchestrator/upgrade-cloud-on-k8s.md)

If your orchestrator is up to date, you can skip this step and proceed with [Upgrading on ECE](/deploy-manage/upgrade/deployment-or-cluster/upgrade-on-ece.md) or [Upgrading on ECK](/deploy-manage/upgrade/deployment-or-cluster/upgrade-on-eck.md).
