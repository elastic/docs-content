# Start and stop services

This section covers the recommended procedures for:

* [starting and stopping self-managed Elasticsearch nodes](start-stop-services/start-stop-elasticsearch.md)
* [starting and stopping self-managed Kibana instances](start-stop-services/start-stop-kibana.md)
* [restarting an ECE deployment](start-stop-services/restart-an-ece-deployment.md)
* [restarting {{ech}} deployments](start-stop-services/restart-cloud-hosted-deployment.md)
* [full cluster and rolling restarts for self-managed clusters](start-stop-services/full-cluster-restart-rolling-restart-procedures.md)

::::{note}
In ECK, when a resource – like {{es}} or {{kib}} – is declared, the reconciliation loop ensures the desired state is maintained. There is no built-in stop mechanism in Kubernetes because it’s designed for declarative state management. You either define a resource, and Kubernetes ensures it’s running, or you delete it. You can restart instances by deleting Pods, as the platform will start them immediately.

Following these guidelines helps prevent data loss, minimize downtime, and maintain optimal performance across different environments.
