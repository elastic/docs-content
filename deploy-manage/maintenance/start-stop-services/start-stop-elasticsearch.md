# Start and stop Elasticsearch

% What needs to be done: Refine

% GitHub issue: https://github.com/elastic/docs-projects/issues/353

% Scope notes: Combine into one topic

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/starting-elasticsearch.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/stopping-elasticsearch.md

% Internal links rely on the following IDs being on this page (e.g. as a heading ID, paragraph ID, etc):

$$$start-deb$$$

$$$start-rpm$$$

$$$_enroll_nodes_in_an_existing_cluster_3$$$

$$$start-es-deb-systemd$$$

**This page is a work in progress.** The documentation team is working to combine content pulled from the following pages:

* [/raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/starting-elasticsearch.md](/raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/starting-elasticsearch.md)
* [/raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/stopping-elasticsearch.md](/raw-migrated-files/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-reference/stopping-elasticsearch.md)
