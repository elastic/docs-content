# Add your billing details [ec-billing-details]

If you want to use {{ecloud}} beyond the trial period or if you want to use features not included in the trial, then you need to add a credit card to your account. Your credit card information is sent securely to our [billing provider](http://recurly.com/security) and stored with them.

Alternatively, if you want to pay for {{ecloud}} together with other cloud services that you're already using, then you can subscribe to {{ecloud}} through a [marketplace](/deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/subscribe-from-marketplace.md).

If you plan to use {{ech}}, then you can estimate how much your use case will cost using our [pricing calculator](https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service/pricing). 

::::{tip} 
Trials get converted to paid subscriptions and billing starts when you add a credit card. If you want to maximize your trial, make sure to add your credit card near the end of the trial period.

To add your billing details:

1. Log in to the [{{ecloud}} Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
2. Select the user icon on the header bar and select **Billing** from the menu.
3. On the **Overview** page, select **Add billing information**.
4. If prompted, complete the multifactor authentication (MFA) required by your bank.

If you want, you can stop new charges by [deleting your project or deployment](/deploy-manage/uninstall/delete-a-cloud-deployment.md).
