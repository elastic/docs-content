# Add your billing details [ec-billing-details]

If you want to use Elasticsearch Service beyond the trial period or if you want to use features not included in the trial, you need to add a credit card to your account. Your credit card information is sent securely to our [billing provider](http://recurly.com/security) and stored with them.

::::{tip} 
Trials get converted to paid subscriptions and billing starts when you add a credit card. If you want to maximize your trial, make sure to add your credit card near the end of the trial period.

Just want a quick price estimate? Try our [Elasticsearch Service pricing calculator](https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service/pricing). Monitor the cost of your deployments by checking [your account usage](monitor-analyze-usage.md). Monthly costs are shown for convenience only, as billing is done by the hour. You can also test with a bigger deployment or try out additional features and only pay for the hours used.

We also offer [AWS Marketplace](../../deploy/elastic-cloud/aws-marketplace.md), [GCP Marketplace](../../deploy/elastic-cloud/google-cloud-platform-marketplace.md), and [Azure Marketplace](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-billing-azure.html) billing, if you prefer not to add a credit card directly.

To add your billing details:

1. Log in to the [Elasticsearch Service Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
2. Select the user icon on the header bar and select **Billing** from the menu.
3. On the **Overview** page, select **Add billing information**.
4. If prompted, complete the multifactor authentication (MFA) required by your bank.

If you want, you can [stop new charges](stop-charges-for-project-deployment.md) by deleting your deployment.
