# Update billing and operational contacts [ec-billing-contacts]

If different persons from your organization are involved in billing and operations, you can specify their relevant contact details in addition to the members set up on the account.

These additional contacts only receive billing or operational emails. You can also set a specific email address to receive monitoring alerts. Members of the account still receive both types of emails.

::::{note} 
Operational contacts can only receive operational notifications, such as out-of-memory alerts. Operational and billing contacts canâ€™t log in to Elasticsearch Service. To log in to the [Elasticsearch Service Console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body), you must use the [primary email address for your account](../../deploy/elastic-cloud/ec-customize-deployment-components.md#ec-user-settings) or be [a member](../../users-roles/cloud-organization.md) of the account.
