# Manage your license in self-managed cluster [managing-licenses]

By default, new installations have a Basic license that never expires. For the full list of features available at the Free and Open Basic subscription level, refer to {{subscriptions}}.

To explore all of the available solutions and features, start a 30-day free trial. You can activate a trial subscription once per major product version. If you need more than 30 days to complete your evaluation, request an extended trial at {{extendtrial}}.

To view the status of your license, start a trial, or install a new license, go to the **License Management** page using the navigation menu or the [global search field](../../explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).


## Required permissions [_required_permissions_3] 

The `manage` cluster privilege is required to access **License Management**.

To add the privilege, go to the **Roles** management page using the navigation menu or the [global search field](../../explore-analyze/find-and-organize/find-apps-and-objects.md).


## License expiration [license-expiration] 

Licenses are valid for a specific time period. 30 days before the license expiration date, {{es}} starts logging expiration warnings. If monitoring is enabled, expiration warnings are displayed prominently in {{kib}}.

If your license expires, your subscription level reverts to Basic and you will no longer be able to use [Platinum or Enterprise features](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions).


## Update your license [update-license] 

Licenses are provided as a *JSON* file and have an effective date and an expiration date. You cannot install a new license before its effective date. License updates take effect immediately and do not require restarting {{es}}.

You can update your license from **Stack Management > License Management** or through the [update license API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/update-license.html).
