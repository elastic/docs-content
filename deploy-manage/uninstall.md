# Uninstall

Uninstalling Elasticsearch can become necessary for several reasons. You might encounter issues during installation that you can't resolve, decommission a host, or want to start fresh with a clean installation.

Each deployment type uses a different uninstallation process. Refer to the guide that matches your setup:

* [Uninstall Elastic Cloud Enterprise](/deploy-manage/uninstall/uninstall-elastic-cloud-enterprise.md)
* [Uninstall Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes](/deploy-manage/uninstall/uninstall-elastic-cloud-on-kubernetes.md)
* [Uninstall a self-managed cluster](/deploy-manage/uninstall/uninstall-a-self-managed-cluster.md)
* [Delete a cloud deployment](/deploy-manage/uninstall/delete-a-cloud-deployment.md)
