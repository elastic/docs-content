# Detection rules

% What needs to be done: Refine

% Scope notes: Add all the troubleshooting content from https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/alerts-ui-monitor.html#troubleshoot-signals as a new section (Rule executions) on this page.

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/security-docs/security/ts-detection-rules.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/security-ts-detection-rules.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/security-docs/security/alerts-ui-monitor.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/docs-content/serverless/security-alerts-ui-monitor.md
