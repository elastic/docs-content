# Check {{kib}} server status [access]
% The fastest way to access {{kib}} is to use our hosted {{es}} Service. If you [installed {{kib}} on your own](../../deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/install-kibana.md), access {{kib}} through the web application.
% 
% 
% ## Set up on cloud [_set_up_on_cloud]
% 
% There’s no faster way to get started than with our hosted {{ess}} on Elastic Cloud:
% 
% 1. [Get a free trial](https://cloud.elastic.co/registration?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
% 2. Log into [Elastic Cloud](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
% 3. Click **Create deployment**.
% 4. Give your deployment a name.
% 5. Click **Create deployment** and download the password for the `elastic` user.
% 
% That’s it! Now that you are up and running, it’s time to get some data into {{kib}}. {{kib}} will open as soon as your deployment is ready.
% 
% 
% ## Log on to the web application [log-on-to-the-web-application]
% 
% If you are using a self-managed deployment, access {{kib}} through the web application on port 5601.
% 
% 1. Point your web browser to the machine where you are running {{kib}} and specify the port number. For example, `localhost:5601` or `http://YOURDOMAIN.com:5601`.
% 
%     To remotely connect to {{kib}}, set [server.host](../../deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/configure.md#server-host) to a non-loopback address.
% 
% 2. Log on to your account.
% 3. Go to the home page, then click **{{kib}}**.
% 4. To make the {{kib}} page your landing page, click **Make this my landing page**.
% 
% 
% ## Check the {{kib}} status [status]
% 

% cf (../../deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/access.md#status) 

The status page displays information about the server resource usage and installed plugins.

To view the {{kib}} status page, use the status endpoint. For example, `localhost:5601/status`.
