# Circuit breaker errors [circuit-breaker-errors]

{{es}} uses [circuit breakers](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/circuit-breaker.html) to prevent nodes from running out of JVM heap memory. If Elasticsearch estimates an operation would exceed a circuit breaker, it stops the operation and returns an error.

By default, the [parent circuit breaker](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/circuit-breaker.html#parent-circuit-breaker) triggers at 95% JVM memory usage. To prevent errors, we recommend taking steps to reduce memory pressure if usage consistently exceeds 85%.

See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3wYlRVbMSw) for a walkthrough of diagnosing circuit breaker errors.

If you’re using Elastic Cloud Hosted, then you can use AutoOps to monitor your cluster. AutoOps significantly simplifies cluster management with performance recommendations, resource utilization visibility, real-time issue detection and resolution paths. For more information, refer to [Monitor with AutoOps](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-autoops.html).

## Diagnose circuit breaker errors [diagnose-circuit-breaker-errors]

**Error messages**

If a request triggers a circuit breaker, {{es}} returns an error with a `429` HTTP status code.

```js
{
  'error': {
    'type': 'circuit_breaking_exception',
    'reason': '[parent] Data too large, data for [<http_request>] would be [123848638/118.1mb], which is larger than the limit of [123273216/117.5mb], real usage: [120182112/114.6mb], new bytes reserved: [3666526/3.4mb]',
    'bytes_wanted': 123848638,
    'bytes_limit': 123273216,
    'durability': 'TRANSIENT'
  },
  'status': 429
}
```

{{es}} also writes circuit breaker errors to [`elasticsearch.log`](../../deploy-manage/monitor/logging-configuration/elasticsearch-log4j-configuration-self-managed.md). This is helpful when automated processes, such as allocation, trigger a circuit breaker.

```txt
Caused by: org.elasticsearch.common.breaker.CircuitBreakingException: [parent] Data too large, data for [<transport_request>] would be [num/numGB], which is larger than the limit of [num/numGB], usages [request=0/0b, fielddata=num/numKB, in_flight_requests=num/numGB, accounting=num/numGB]
```

**Check JVM memory usage**

If you’ve enabled Stack Monitoring, you can view JVM memory usage in {{kib}}. In the main menu, click **Stack Monitoring**. On the Stack Monitoring **Overview*** page, click ***Nodes**. The **JVM Heap** column lists the current memory usage for each node.

You can also use the [cat nodes API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-cat-nodes) to get the current `heap.percent` for each node.

```console
GET _cat/nodes?v=true&h=name,node*,heap*
```

To get the JVM memory usage for each circuit breaker, use the [node stats API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-nodes-stats).

```console
GET _nodes/stats/breaker
```


## Prevent circuit breaker errors [prevent-circuit-breaker-errors]

**Reduce JVM memory pressure**

High JVM memory pressure often causes circuit breaker errors. See [High JVM memory pressure](high-jvm-memory-pressure.md).

**Avoid using fielddata on `text` fields**

For high-cardinality `text` fields, fielddata can use a large amount of JVM memory. To avoid this, {{es}} disables fielddata on `text` fields by default. If you’ve enabled fielddata and triggered the [fielddata circuit breaker](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/circuit-breaker.html#fielddata-circuit-breaker), consider disabling it and using a `keyword` field instead. See [`fielddata` mapping parameter](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/text.html#fielddata-mapping-param).

**Clear the fielddata cache**

If you’ve triggered the fielddata circuit breaker and can’t disable fielddata, use the [clear cache API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-clear-cache) to clear the fielddata cache. This may disrupt any in-flight searches that use fielddata.

```console
POST _cache/clear?fielddata=true
```
