# Internal server error in Kibana [trb-security-internalserver]

**Symptoms:**

* In 5.1.1, an `UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning` occurs and {{kib}} displays an Internal Server Error.

**Resolution:**

If the Security plugin is enabled in {{es}} but disabled in {{kib}}, you must still set `elasticsearch.username` and `elasticsearch.password` in [`kibana.yml`](/deploy-manage/stack-settings.md). Otherwise, {{kib}} cannot connect to {{es}}.
