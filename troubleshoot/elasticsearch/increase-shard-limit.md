# Total number of shards for an index on a single node exceeded [increase-shard-limit]

Elasticsearch tries to take advantage of all the available resources by distributing data (index shards) among nodes in the cluster.

Users might want to influence this data distribution by configuring the [index.routing.allocation.total_shards_per_node](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/allocation-total-shards.html#total-shards-per-node) index setting to a custom value (for e.g. `1` in case of a highly trafficked index). Various configurations limiting how many shards an index can have located on one node can lead to shards being unassigned due to the cluster not having enough nodes to satisfy the index configuration.

In order to fix this follow the next steps:

:::::::{tab-set}

::::::{tab-item} Elasticsearch Service
In order to get the shards assigned we’ll need to increase the number of shards that can be collocated on a node. We’ll achieve this by inspecting the configuration for the `index.routing.allocation.total_shards_per_node` [index setting](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-get-settings) and increasing the configured value for the indices that have shards unassigned.

**Use {{kib}}**

1. Log in to the [{{ecloud}} console](https://cloud.elastic.co?page=docs&placement=docs-body).
2. On the **Elasticsearch Service** panel, click the name of your deployment.

    ::::{note}
    If the name of your deployment is disabled your {{kib}} instances might be unhealthy, in which case please contact [Elastic Support](https://support.elastic.co). If your deployment doesn’t include {{kib}}, all you need to do is [enable it first](../../deploy-manage/deploy/elastic-cloud/access-kibana.md).
    ::::

3. Open your deployment’s side navigation menu (placed under the Elastic logo in the upper left corner) and go to **Dev Tools > Console**.

4. Inspect the `index.routing.allocation.total_shards_per_node` [index setting](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-get-settings) for the index with unassigned shards:

    ```console
    GET /my-index-000001/_settings/index.routing.allocation.total_shards_per_node?flat_settings
    ```

    The response will look like this:

    ```console-result
    {
      "my-index-000001": {
        "settings": {
          "index.routing.allocation.total_shards_per_node": "1" <1>
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    1. Represents the current configured value for the total number of shards that can reside on one node for the `my-index-000001` index.

5. [Increase](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-put-settings) the value for the total number of shards that can be assigned on one node to a higher value:

    ```console
    PUT /my-index-000001/_settings
    {
      "index" : {
        "routing.allocation.total_shards_per_node" : "2" <1>
      }
    }
    ```

    1. The new value for the `total_shards_per_node` configuration for the `my-index-000001` index is increased from the previous value of `1` to `2`. The `total_shards_per_node` configuration can also be set to `-1`, which represents no upper bound with regards to how many shards of the same index can reside on one node.

::::::{tab-item} Self-managed
In order to get the shards assigned you can add more nodes to your {{es}} cluster and assing the index’s target tier [node role](../../manage-data/lifecycle/index-lifecycle-management/migrate-index-allocation-filters-to-node-roles.md#assign-data-tier) to the new nodes.

To inspect which tier is an index targeting for assignment, use the [get index setting](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-get-settings) API to retrieve the configured value for the `index.routing.allocation.include._tier_preference` setting:

```console
GET /my-index-000001/_settings/index.routing.allocation.include._tier_preference?flat_settings
```

The response will look like this:

```console-result
{
  "my-index-000001": {
    "settings": {
      "index.routing.allocation.include._tier_preference": "data_warm,data_hot" <1>
    }
  }
}
```

1. Represents a comma separated list of data tier node roles this index is allowed to be allocated on, the first one in the list being the one with the higher priority i.e. the tier the index is targeting. e.g. in this example the tier preference is `data_warm,data_hot` so the index is targeting the `warm` tier and more nodes with the `data_warm` role are needed in the {{es}} cluster.


Alternatively, if adding more nodes to the {{es}} cluster is not desired, inspecting the configuration for the `index.routing.allocation.total_shards_per_node` [index setting](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-get-settings) and increasing the configured value will allow more shards to be assigned on the same node.

1. Inspect the `index.routing.allocation.total_shards_per_node` [index setting](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-get-settings) for the index with unassigned shards:

    ```console
    GET /my-index-000001/_settings/index.routing.allocation.total_shards_per_node?flat_settings
    ```

    The response will look like this:

    ```console-result
    {
      "my-index-000001": {
        "settings": {
          "index.routing.allocation.total_shards_per_node": "1" <1>
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    1. Represents the current configured value for the total number of shards that can reside on one node for the `my-index-000001` index.

2. [Increase](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-put-settings) the total number of shards that can be assigned on one node or reset the value to unbounded (`-1`):

    ```console
    PUT /my-index-000001/_settings
    {
      "index" : {
        "routing.allocation.total_shards_per_node" : -1
      }
    }
    ```
