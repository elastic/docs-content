# Rejected requests [rejected-requests]

When {{es}} rejects a request, it stops the operation and returns an error with a `429` response code. Rejected requests are commonly caused by:

* A [depleted thread pool](high-cpu-usage.md). A depleted `search` or `write` thread pool returns a `TOO_MANY_REQUESTS` error message.
* A [circuit breaker error](circuit-breaker-errors.md).
* High [indexing pressure](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-modules-indexing-pressure.html) that exceeds the [`indexing_pressure.memory.limit`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-modules-indexing-pressure.html#memory-limits).

If you’re using Elastic Cloud Hosted, then you can use AutoOps to monitor your cluster. AutoOps significantly simplifies cluster management with performance recommendations, resource utilization visibility, real-time issue detection and resolution paths. For more information, refer to [Monitor with AutoOps](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-autoops.html).

## Check rejected tasks [check-rejected-tasks]

To check the number of rejected tasks for each thread pool, use the [cat thread pool API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-cat-thread-pool). A high ratio of `rejected` to `completed` tasks, particularly in the `search` and `write` thread pools, means {{es}} regularly rejects requests.

```console
GET /_cat/thread_pool?v=true&h=id,name,queue,active,rejected,completed
```

`write` thread pool rejections frequently appear in the erring API and correlating log as `EsRejectedExecutionException` with either `QueueResizingEsThreadPoolExecutor` or `queue capacity`.

These errors are often related to [backlogged tasks](task-queue-backlog.md).

See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auZJRXoAVpI) for a walkthrough of troubleshooting threadpool rejections.


## Check circuit breakers [check-circuit-breakers]

To check the number of tripped [circuit breakers](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/circuit-breaker.html), use the [node stats API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-nodes-stats).

```console
GET /_nodes/stats/breaker
```

These statistics are cumulative from node startup. For more information, see [circuit breaker errors](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/circuit-breaker.html).

See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3wYlRVbMSw) for a walkthrough of diagnosing circuit breaker errors.


## Check indexing pressure [check-indexing-pressure]

To check the number of [indexing pressure](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-modules-indexing-pressure.html) rejections, use the [node stats API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-nodes-stats).

```console
GET _nodes/stats?human&filter_path=nodes.*.indexing_pressure
```

These stats are cumulative from node startup.

Indexing pressure rejections appear as an `EsRejectedExecutionException`, and indicate that they were rejected due to `combined_coordinating_and_primary`, `coordinating`, `primary`, or `replica`.

These errors are often related to [backlogged tasks](task-queue-backlog.md), [bulk index](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-bulk) sizing, or the ingest target’s [`refresh_interval` setting](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-modules.html).

See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuV8QqSfc0c) for a walkthrough of diagnosing indexing pressure rejections.


## Prevent rejected requests [prevent-rejected-requests]

**Fix high CPU and memory usage**

If {{es}} regularly rejects requests and other tasks, your cluster likely has high CPU usage or high JVM memory pressure. For tips, see [High CPU usage](high-cpu-usage.md) and [High JVM memory pressure](high-jvm-memory-pressure.md).
