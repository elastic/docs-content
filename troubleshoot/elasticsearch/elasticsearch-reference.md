# Elasticsearch [troubleshooting]

This section provides a series of troubleshooting solutions aimed at helping users fix problems that an {{es}} deployment might encounter.

::::{admonition}
If youâ€™re using Elastic Cloud Hosted, then you can use AutoOps to monitor your cluster. AutoOps significantly simplifies cluster management with performance recommendations, resource utilization visibility, real-time issue detection and resolution paths. For more information, refer to [Monitor with AutoOps](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-autoops.html).
