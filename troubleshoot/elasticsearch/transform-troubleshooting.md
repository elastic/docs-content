# Troubleshoot transforms [transform-troubleshooting]

Use the information in this section to troubleshoot common problems.

:::{tip}
If you can't find your issue here, explore the other [troubleshooting topics](/troubleshoot/index.md) or [contact us](/troubleshoot/index.md#contact-us).
:::

If you encounter problems with your {{transforms}}, you can gather more information from the following files and APIs:

* Lightweight audit messages are stored in `.transform-notifications-read`. Search by your `transform_id`.
* The [get {{transform}} statistics API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-transform-get-transform-stats) provides information about the {{transform}} status and failures.
* If the {{transform}} exists as a task, you can use the [task management API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/group/endpoint-tasks) to gather task information. For example: `GET _tasks?actions=data_frame/transforms*&detailed`. Typically, the task exists when the {{transform}} is in a started or failed state.
* The {{es}} logs from the node that was running the {{transform}} might also contain useful information. You can identify the node from the notification messages. Alternatively, if the task still exists, you can get that information from the get {{transform}} statistics API. For more information, see [*Elasticsearch application logging*](../../deploy-manage/monitor/logging-configuration/elasticsearch-log4j-configuration-self-managed.md).
