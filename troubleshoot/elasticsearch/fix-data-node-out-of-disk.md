# Fix data nodes out of disk [fix-data-node-out-of-disk]

{{es}} is using data nodes to distribute your data inside the cluster. If one or more of these nodes are running out of space, {{es}} takes action to redistribute your data within the nodes so all nodes have enough available disk space. If {{es}} cannot facilitate enough available space in a node, then you will need to intervene in one of two ways:

1. [Increase the disk capacity of your cluster](increase-capacity-data-node.md)
2. [Reduce the disk usage by decreasing your data volume](decrease-disk-usage-data-node.md)
