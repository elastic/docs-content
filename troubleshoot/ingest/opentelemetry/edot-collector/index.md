# Troubleshoot the EDOT Collector

Perform these checks when troubleshooting common Collector issues:

* Check logs: Review the Collectorâ€™s logs for error messages.
* Validate configuration: Use the `--dry-run` option to test configurations.
* Enable debug logging: Run the Collector with `--log-level=debug` for detailed logs.
* Check service status: Ensure the Collector is running with `systemctl status <collector-service>` (Linux) or `tasklist` (Windows).
* Test connectivity: Use `telnet <endpoint> <port>` or `curl` to verify backend availability.
* Check open ports: Run netstat `-tulnp or lsof -i` to confirm the Collector is listening.
* Monitor resource usage: Use top/htop (Linux) or Task Manager (Windows) to check CPU & memory.
* Validate exporters: Ensure exporters are properly configured and reachable.
* Verify pipelines: Use `otelctl` diagnose (if available) to check pipeline health.
* Check permissions: Ensure the Collector has the right file and network permissions.
* Review recent changes: Roll back recent config updates if the issue started after changes.
