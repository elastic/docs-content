# Troubleshooting the EDOT iOS agent [troubleshooting]

When troubleshooting the EDOT iOS agent, ensure your app is compatible with the agent’s [supported technologies](apm-agent-ios://reference/edot-ios/supported-technologies.md).

If you’re an existing Elastic customer with a support contract, create a ticket in the [Elastic Support portal](https://support.elastic.co/customers/s/login/). Other users can post in the [APM discuss forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/apm).

::::{important}
**Upload your complete debug logs** to a service like [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com) so that we can analyze the problem. Logs should include everything from when the application starts up until the first request executes.
