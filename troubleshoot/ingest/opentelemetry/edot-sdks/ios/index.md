# Troubleshooting the EDOT iOS agent [troubleshooting]

This page provides guidance for resolving common problems when instrumenting iOS applications with the {{edot}} (EDOT) SDK.

When troubleshooting the EDOT iOS agent, ensure your app is compatible with the agent’s [supported technologies](apm-agent-ios://reference/edot-ios/supported-technologies.md).


## SDK fails to export data

If your app is running but no telemetry reaches Elastic, the SDK might be failing to send data to the configured endpoint.

### Symptoms [symptoms-fail-to-export]

You might notice the following signs when the SDK cannot export data:

* No telemetry appears in Elastic.
* Application logs show errors such as:

  ```text
  [ElasticOtelExporter] Failed to send spans: Error Domain=NSURLErrorDomain Code=-1004 "Could not connect to the server"
  ```

* The OpenTelemetry Collector or Elastic endpoint shows no received data.

### Causes [causes-fail-to-export]

This usually happens if the iOS app cannot reach the configured OTLP endpoint due to:

* Incorrect endpoint URL or port.
* TLS/HTTPS certificate issues.
* Missing App Transport Security (ATS) configuration in `Info.plist`.

### Resolution [resolution-fail-to-export]

Try the following steps to resolve the issue:

* Verify the endpoint URL and port in your SDK configuration.
* If using HTTPS with self-signed certificates, add the certificate to the iOS trust store or configure ATS exceptions.
* Add required ATS exceptions to your app’s `Info.plist`. For example:

  ```xml
  <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
  <dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
  </dict>
  ```


## No data when app is in the background

If data only appears while the app is in the foreground, the issue might be related to iOS background execution limits.

### Symptoms [symptoms-no-data]

The following behavior indicates that telemetry stops when the app moves to the background:

* Telemetry appears only when the app is in the foreground.

* Spans or metrics are missing after backgrounding the app.

### Causes [causes-no-data]

This issue can occur because of how iOS manages background tasks and network activity:

* iOS aggressively suspends background network activity. The SDK cannot flush telemetry if the app is suspended.

### Resolution [resolution-no-data]

Use the following recommendations to ensure data export continues as expected:

* Ensure that export intervals are short enough to flush before suspension.

* Use iOS background modes if appropriate for your app (for example `Background fetch`, `Background processing`).

* For crash or cold-start telemetry, rely on batching and retry when the app next resumes.


## Missing device or app metadata

If telemetry is sent but key attributes such as device model, OS version, or app version are missing, resource detection might not be working correctly.

### Symptoms [symptoms-missing-device]

You might encounter the following when resource detection is incomplete:

* Spans or metrics appear in Elastic, but expected resource attributes (for example device model, OS version, app version) are missing.

### Causes [causes-missing-device]

Common causes include turned off resource detectors or missing permissions:

* Resource detectors might not be enabled, or required permissions might not be granted.

### Resolution [resolution-missing-device]

To restore full metadata reporting, verify the following:

* Ensure the iOS resource detectors are enabled in the SDK initialization.

* Verify your build includes the `DeviceResourceDetector` and `OSResourceDetector`.

* Check privacy permissions (for example for network or device identifiers, if used).


## Crashes or startup delays after SDK initialization

If the app crashes or slows down significantly after integrating the SDK, initialization or exporter configuration might be the cause.

### Symptoms [symptoms-crash]

The following symptoms can indicate SDK-related performance or initialization issues:

* App crashes immediately after launching with the SDK enabled.

* Noticeable delays before the first screen appears.

### Causes [causes-crash]

Crashes or slow startup typically occur for one of these reasons:

* The SDK is initialized on the main thread with heavy configuration.

* Exporters are misconfigured and blocking startup.

### Resolution [resolution-crash]

Try these steps to resolve initialization and startup issues:

* Initialize the SDK on a background thread when possible.

* Use asynchronous exporters.

* Start with minimal configuration and gradually add exporters to isolate the issue.


## Next steps

If problems persist:

* Review the [iOS SDK reference documentation](apm-agent-ios://reference/edot-ios/index.md).

* [Enable debug logging for the Collector](../../edot-collector/enable-debug-logging.md) and [the SDKs](../enable-debug-logging.md).

  ::::{important}
  **Upload your complete debug logs** to a service like [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com) so that we can analyze the problem. Logs should include everything from when the application starts up until the first request executes.
