# Troubleshoot Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes [k8s-troubleshooting]

:::{admonition} WIP
⚠️ **This page is a work in progress.** ⚠️

The documentation team is working on restructuring this section. It currently reflects a legacy product-centric structure.
:::

* [*Common problems*](common-problems.md)
* [*Troubleshooting methods*](troubleshooting-methods.md)
* [*Run eck-diagnostics*](run-eck-diagnostics.md)

If you are an existing Elastic customer with an active support contract, you can create a case in the [Elastic Support Portal](https://support.elastic.co/). Kindly attach an [ECK diagnostic](run-eck-diagnostics.md) when opening your case.

Alternatively, or if you do not have a support contract, and if you are unable to find a solution to your problem with the information provided in these documents, ask for help:

* [ECK Discuss forums](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/eck) to ask any question
* [Github issues](https://github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s/issues) for bugs and feature requests
