# Heap dumps [ece-capture-heap-dumps]

From the Elastic Cloud Enterprise console you can capture JVM heap dumps from deployment instances. This can aid in debugging memory-related issues. Elastic Cloud Enterprise supports two kinds of heap dumps: out-of-memory and on-demand. Out-of-memory heap dumps are captured when the instance JVM runs out of memory and crashes. On-demand heap dumps can be captured from a running instance at any time.


## Viewing and downloading heap dumps [ece-view-heap-dumps] 

You can view and download captured heap dumps for a given deployment.

1. [Log into the Cloud UI](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-enterprise/log-into-cloud-ui.md).
2. On the **Deployments** page, select your deployment.

    Narrow the list by name, ID, or choose from several other filters. To further define the list, use a combination of filters.

3. From your deployment menu go to the **Heap dumps** page.

From this page, you can view all heap dumps that have been captured on your deployment and download a heap dump for analysis.

::::{note} 
Only one heap dump is retained per instance.

::::{warning} 
Heap dumps contain the unsanitized contents of the instanceâ€™s heap. There are typically secrets and other sensitive data contained in heap dumps, and great care should be taken when handling and sharing them.

## Capturing a new on-demand heap dump [ece-capture-on-demand-heap-dump] 

You can capture an on-demand heap dump from the deployment overview page.

::::{note} 
The JVM will be paused while the heap dump is being captured, so there may be a temporary performance or availability impact. Only one heap dump can be captured from a given instance at a time.

1. [Log into the Cloud UI](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-enterprise/log-into-cloud-ui.md).
2. On the **Deployments** page, select your deployment.

    Narrow the list by name, ID, or choose from several other filters. To further define the list, use a combination of filters.

3. From the deployment overview, find the instance you want to capture a heap dump from, select the instance context menu, and choose **Capture heap dump**

Alternatively, you can capture an on-demand heap dump directly from the **Heap dumps** page.

1. [Log into the Cloud UI](../../../deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-enterprise/log-into-cloud-ui.md).
2. On the **Deployments** page, select your deployment.

    Narrow the list by name, ID, or choose from several other filters. To further define the list, use a combination of filters.

3. From your deployment menu, go to the **Heap dumps** page.
4. From the dropdown, choose the instance you want to capture a heap dump from, and select **Start capture**
