For issues with Elastic Cloud Enterprise that you cannot fix yourself …​ we’re here to help!

If you are an existing Elastic customer with a support contract, please create a ticket in the  [Elastic Support Portal](https://support.elastic.co) and provide an ECE [diagnostics package and log files](../../../deploy-manage/monitor/orchestrators/ece-monitoring-ece-access.md). By providing a diagnostics package, you make it easier for us to help you.

Alternatively, or if you do not have a support contract, you can post in the [Elastic Cloud Enterprise forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/cloud-enterprise) to get help.
