# Troubleshoot deployment health warnings [ece-deployment-no-op]

The {{ece}} **Deployments** page shows the current status of your active deployments. From time to time you may get one or more health warnings, such as the following:

:alt: A screen capture of the deployment page showing a typical warning: Deployment health warning: Latest change to {{es}} configuration failed.

**Single warning**

To resolve a single health warning, we recommended first running a _no-op_ (no operation) plan. This performs a rolling update on the components in your Elastic Cloud Enterprise deployment without actually applying any configuration changes. This is often all thatâ€™s needed to resolve a health warning on the UI.

To run a no-op plan:

1. [Log into the Cloud UI](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-enterprise/current/ece-login.html).
2. Select a deployment.

    Narrow the list by name, ID, or choose from several other filters. To further define the list, use a combination of filters.

3. From your deployment menu, go to the **Edit** page.
4. Select **Save**.

**Multiple warnings**

If multiple health warnings appear for one of your deployments, check [](/troubleshoot/deployments/cloud-enterprise/common-issues.md) or [contact us](/troubleshoot/index.md#contact-us).
