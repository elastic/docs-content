# Troubleshoot

% What needs to be done: Refine

% Scope notes: - Match new content type; TOC entry TBD - consider splitting out subsections?

% Use migrated content from existing pages that map to this page:

% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/tech-content/starting-with-the-elasticsearch-platform-and-its-solutions/get-support-help.md
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/tech-content/starting-with-the-elasticsearch-platform-and-its-solutions/troubleshooting-and-faqs.md
% - next one added by marciw manually for tracking
% - [ ] ./raw-migrated-files/cloud/cloud/ec-get-help.md (especially IDs -- no generated list because page was incorrectly mapped to a new v3 page instead of as a many-to-one for this page)
