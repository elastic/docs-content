# Troubleshooting

:::{admonition} WIP
⚠️ **This section is a work in progress.** ⚠️

The documentation team is actively working on the pages in this section.
:::

This section contains troubleshooting resources and guidance to help you resolve issues with Elastic products.

If you can't find your issue here, explore the [additional resources](#troubleshoot-additional-resources) or [contact us](#contact-us).

:::{note} 
You might need to review troubleshooting content for more than one product or topic area. Most Elastic deployments use multiple components from the [Elastic Stack](/get-started/the-stack.md), plus a deployment orchestrator. Check all topics relevant to your infrastructure.

## Additional resources [troubleshoot-additional-resources]

If you have an [Elastic subscription](https://www.elastic.co/pricing), you can contact Elastic support for assistance. You can reach us in the following ways:

## Working with support [troubleshoot-work-with-support]

Try these tips when opening a support case:

* Include the deployment ID that you want help with, especially if you have several deployments. 

  You can find the deployment ID on the overview page for your cluster in the {{ecloud}} Console.

* Describe the problem. Include any relevant details, including error messages you encountered, dates and times when the problem occurred, or anything else you think might be helpful.

* Upload any pertinent files.
