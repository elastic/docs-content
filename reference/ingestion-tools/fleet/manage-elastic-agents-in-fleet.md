# Centrally manage {{agent}}s in {{fleet}} [manage-agents-in-fleet]


::::{admonition}
The {{fleet}} app in {{kib}} supports both {{agent}} infrastructure management and agent policy management. You can use {{fleet}} to:

* Manage {{agent}} binaries and specify settings installed on the host that determine whether the {{agent}} is enrolled in {{fleet}}, what version of the agent is running, and which agent policy is used.
* Manage agent policies that specify agent configuration settings, which integrations are running, whether agent monitoring is turned on, input settings, and so on.

Advanced users who donâ€™t want to use {{fleet}} for central management can use an external infrastructure management solution and [install {{agent}} in standalone mode](/reference/ingestion-tools/fleet/install-standalone-elastic-agent.md) instead.

::::


::::{important}
{{fleet}} currently requires a {{kib}} user with `All` privileges on {{fleet}} and {{integrations}}. Since many Integrations assets are shared across spaces, users need the {{kib}} privileges in all spaces. Refer to [Required roles and privileges](/reference/ingestion-tools/fleet/fleet-roles-privileges.md) to learn how to create a user role with the required privileges to access {{fleet}} and {{integrations}}.

To learn how to add {{agent}}s to {{fleet}}, refer to [Install {{fleet}}-managed {{agent}}s](/reference/ingestion-tools/fleet/install-fleet-managed-elastic-agent.md).
