# View {{agent}} integration policies [view-integration-policies]


An integration policy is created when you add an [integration](integration-docs://docs/reference/index.md) to an {{agent}} policy.

To view details about all the integration policies for a specific integration:

1. In {{kib}}, go to the **Integrations** page and open the **Installed integrations** tab. Search for and select the integration you want to view. You can select a category to narrow your search.
2. Click the **Policies** tab to see the list of integration policies.

Open the **Actions** menu to see other actions you can perform from this view.
