# Elastic Agent health status [agent-health-status]

The {{agent}} [monitoring documentation](/reference/ingestion-tools/fleet/monitor-elastic-agent.md) describes the features available through the {{fleet}} UI for you to view {{agent}} status and activity, access metrics and diagnostics, enable alerts, and more.

For details about how the {{agent}} status is monitored by {{fleet}}, including connectivity, check-in frequency, and similar, see the following:

* [How does {{agent}} connect to the {{fleet}} to report its availability and health, and receive policy updates?](#agent-health-status-connect-to-fleet)
* [We use stack monitoring to monitor the status of our cluster. Is monitoring of {{agent}} and the status shown in {{fleet}} using stack monitoring as well?](#agent-health-status-stack-monitoring)
* [There are many components that make up {{agent}}. How does {{agent}} ensure that these components/processes are up and running, and healthy?](#agent-health-status-other-components)
* [If {{agent}} goes down, is an alert generated by {{fleet}}?](#agent-health-status-outage)
* [How long does it take for {{agent}} to report a status change?](#agent-health-status-report-timing)


## How does {{agent}} connect to the {{fleet}} to report its availability and health, and receive policy updates? [agent-health-status-connect-to-fleet]

After enrollment, {{agent}} regularly initiates a check-in to {{fleet-server}} using HTTP long-polling ({{fleet-server}} is either deployed on-premises or deployed as part of {{es}} in {{ecloud}}).

The HTTP long-polling request is kept open until there’s a configuration change that {{agent}} needs to consume, an action that is sent to the agent, or a 5 minute timeout has elapsed. After 5 minutes, the agent will again send another check-in to start the process over again.

The frequency of check-ins can be configured to a new value with the condition that it may affect the maximum number of agents that can connect to {{fleet}}. Our regular scale testing of the solution doesn’t modify this parameter.

## We use stack monitoring to monitor the status of our cluster. Is monitoring of {{agent}} and the status shown in {{fleet}} using stack monitoring as well? [agent-health-status-stack-monitoring]

No. The health monitoring of {{agent}} and its inputs, as reported in {{fleet}}, is done completely outside of what stack monitoring provides.


## There are many components that make up {{agent}}. How does {{agent}} ensure that these components/processes are up and running, and healthy? [agent-health-status-other-components]

{{agent}} is essentially a supervisor that (at a minimum) will deploy a {{filebeat}} instance for log collection and a {{metricbeat}} instance for metrics collection from the system and applications running on that system. As a supervisor, it also ensures that these spawned processes are running and healthy. Using gRPC, {{agent}} communicates with the underlying processes once every 30 seconds, ensuring their health. If there’s no response, the agent will transfer to being `Unhealthy` with the result and details reported to {{fleet}}.


## If {{agent}} goes down, is an alert generated by {{fleet}}? [agent-health-status-outage]

No. Alerts would have to be created in {{kib}} on the indices that show the total count of agents at each specific state. Refer to [Enable alerts and ML jobs based on {{fleet}} and {{agent}} status](/reference/ingestion-tools/fleet/monitor-elastic-agent.md#fleet-alerting) in the {{agent}} monitoring documentation for the steps to configure alerting. Generating alerts on status change on individual agents is currently planned for a future release.


## How long does it take for {{agent}} to report a status change? [agent-health-status-report-timing]

Some {{agent}} states are reported immediately, such as when the agent has become `Unhealthy`. Some other states are derived after a certain criteria is met. Refer to [View agent status overview](/reference/ingestion-tools/fleet/monitor-elastic-agent.md#view-agent-status) in the {{agent}} monitoring documentation for details about monitoring agent status.

Transition from an `Offline` state to an `Inactive` state is configurable by the user and that transition can be fine tuned by [Setting the inactivity timeout parameter](/reference/ingestion-tools/fleet/set-inactivity-timeout.md).
