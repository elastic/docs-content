# Edit or delete an {{agent}} integration policy [edit-or-delete-integration-policy]


To edit or delete an integration policy:

1. In {{kib}}, go to the **Integrations** page and open the **Installed integrations** tab. Search for and select the integration.
2. Click the **Policies** tab to see the list of integration policies.
3. Scroll to a specific integration policy. Open the **Actions** menu and select **Edit integration** or **Delete integration**.

    Editing or deleting an integration is permanent and cannot be undone. If you make a mistake, you can always re-configure or re-add an integration.


Any saved changes are immediately distributed and applied to all {{agent}}s enrolled in the given policy.
