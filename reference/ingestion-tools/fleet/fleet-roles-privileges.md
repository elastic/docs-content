# Required roles and privileges [fleet-roles-and-privileges]

Assigning the {{kib}} feature privileges `Fleet` and `Integrations` grants access to use {{fleet}} and Integrations.

`all`
:   Grants full read-write access.

`read`
:   Grants read-only access.

`none`
:   No access is granted.

Take advantage of these privilege settings by:

* [Using an {{es}} built-in role](#fleet-roles-and-privileges-built-in)
* [Creating a new role](#fleet-roles-and-privileges-create)

## Built-in roles [fleet-roles-and-privileges-built-in]

{{es}} comes with built-in roles that include default privileges.

`editor`
:   The built-in `editor` role grants the following privileges, supporting full read-write access to {{fleet}} and Integrations:
* {{Fleet}}: `all`
* Integrations: `all`

`viewer`
:   The built-in `viewer` role grants the following privileges, supporting read-only access to {{fleet}} and Integrations:

* {{Fleet}}:: `read`
* Integrations:: `read`

You can also create a new role that can be assigned to a user, in order to grant more specific levels of access to {{fleet}} and Integrations.

6. In the {{kib}} section, select **Assign to space**.
