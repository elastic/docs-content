# View {{agent}} integration assets [view-integration-assets]


{{agent}} integrations come with a number of assets, such as dashboards, saved searches, and visualizations for analyzing data.

To view integration assets:

1. In {{kib}}, go to the **Integrations** page and open the **Installed integrations** tab. Search for and select the integration you want to view.
2. Click the **Assets** tab to see a list of assets. If this tab does not exist, the assets are not installed.

If {{agent}} is already streaming data to {{es}}, you can follow the links to view the assets in {{kib}}.
