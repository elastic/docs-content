Follow these security best practices:

* Use mutual TLS to output connections in high-security environments.
* Prefer API keys or service tokens over basic authentication for output connections.
* Consider network segmentation to limit which hosts can connect to {{fleet-server}}.
* Keep {{component_ref}} versions up to date to benefit from security patches.
