# Remote {{es}} output [remote-elasticsearch-output]

Remote {{es}} outputs allow you to send {{agent}} data to a remote {{es}} cluster. This is especially useful for data that you want to keep separate and independent from the deployment where you use {{fleet}} to manage the {{agent}}s.

A remote {{es}} cluster supports the same [output settings](/reference/fleet/es-output-settings.md) as your management {{es}} cluster.

## Limitations

These limitations apply to remote {{es}} output:

* Using a remote {{es}} output with a target cluster that has [network security](/deploy-manage/security/network-security.md) enabled is not currently supported.
* Using {{elastic-defend}} when a remote {{es}} output is configured for an {{agent}} is not currently supported.

## Configuration [remote-output-config]

To configure a remote {{es}} cluster for your {{agent}} data:

:::::{stepper}

::::{step}
In your management {{es}} cluster, open {{kib}}, and search for **Fleet settings** in the search bar. Select **Fleet/Settings** in the results.
::::

::::{step}
In the **Outputs** section, select **Add output**.
::::

::::{step}
In the **Add new output** flyout, provide a name for the output, and select **Remote Elasticsearch** as the output type.
::::

::::{step}
In the **Hosts** field, add the URL that {{agent}}s should use to access the remote {{es}} cluster.

:::{dropdown} Find the remote host address of the remote cluster
:open:
1. In the remote cluster, open {{kib}}, and search for **Fleet settings** in the search bar. Select **Fleet/Settings** in the results.
2. In the **Outputs** section, copy the `Hosts` value of the default {{es}} output. If the value is not visible in full, edit the default  {{es}} output to display the full value.
3. In your management cluster, paste the value you copied into the **Hosts** field of the remote output configuration.
:::
::::

::::{step}
In the **Service Token** field, add a service token to access the remote cluster.

:::{dropdown} Create a service token to access the remote cluster
:open:
1. Copy the API request located below the **Service Token** field.
2. In the remote cluster, open the {{kib}} menu, then go to **Management** → **Dev Tools** in self-managed deployments, or to **Developer tools** in {{ecloud}} deployments.
3. Paste the API request in the console, then run it.
4. Copy the value for the generated service token.
5. In the management cluster, paste the value you copied into the **Service Token** field of the remote output configuration.
:::

:::{note}
To prevent unauthorized access, the {{es}} Service Token is stored as a secret value. While secret storage is recommended, you can choose to override this setting, and store the password as plain text in the agent policy definition. Secret storage requires {{fleet-server}} version 8.12 or higher. This setting can also be stored as a secret value or as plain text for preconfigured outputs. To learn more about this option, check [Preconfiguration settings](kibana://reference/configuration-reference/fleet-settings.md#_preconfiguration_settings_for_advanced_use_cases).
:::
::::

::::{step}
Choose whether integrations should be automatically synchronized on the remote {{es}} cluster. To configure this feature, refer to [Automatic integrations synchronization](/reference/fleet/automatic-integrations-synchronization.md).

:::{note}
Automatic integrations synchronization is only available with certain subscriptions. For more information, refer to [Subscriptions](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions).
:::
::::

::::{step}
Choose whether the remote output should be the default for agent integrations or for agent monitoring data. When set as the default, {{agents}} use this output to send data if no other output is set in the [agent policy](/reference/fleet/agent-policy.md).
::::

::::{step}
Select the [performance tuning settings](/reference/fleet/es-output-settings.md#es-output-settings-performance-tuning-settings) to optimize {{agent}}s for throughput, scale, or latency, or leave the default `balanced` setting.
::::

::::{step}
Add any [advanced YAML configuration settings](/reference/fleet/es-output-settings.md#es-output-settings-yaml-config) that you’d like for the remote output.
::::

::::{step}
Click **Save and apply settings**.
::::

:::::

## Using the remote {{es}} output

After the output is created, you can update an {{agent}} policy to use the new output, and send data to the remote {{es}} cluster:

1. In the management cluster, go to **{{fleet}}**, then open the **Agent policies** tab.
2. Click the agent policy you want to update, then click **Settings**.
3. To send integrations data, set the **Output for integrations** option to use the output that you configured in the previous steps.
4. To send {{agent}} monitoring data, set the **Output for agent monitoring** option to use the output that you configured in the previous steps.
5. Click **Save changes**.

The remote {{es}} output is now configured for the remote cluster.

If you choose not to synchronize integrations automatically, you need to make sure that for any integrations that are [added to your {{agent}} policy](/reference/fleet/add-integration-to-policy.md), the integration assets are also installed on the remote {{es}} cluster. For detailed steps on this process, refer to [Install and uninstall {{agent}} integration assets](/reference/fleet/install-uninstall-integration-assets.md).

::::{note}
When you use a remote {{es}} output, {{fleet-server}} performs a test to ensure connectivity to the remote cluster. The result of that connectivity test is used to report whether the remote output is healthy or unhealthy, and is displayed on the **{{fleet}}** → **Settings** → **Outputs** page, in the **Status** column.

In some cases, the remote {{es}} output used for {{agent}} data can be reached by the {{agent}}s but not by {{fleet-server}}. In those cases, you can ignore the resulting unhealthy state of the output and the associated `Unable to connect` error on the UI.
