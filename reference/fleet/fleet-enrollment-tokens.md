# Fleet enrollment tokens [fleet-enrollment-tokens]

A {{fleet}} enrollment token (referred to as an `enrollment API key` in the {{fleet}} API documentation) is an {{es}} API key that you use to enroll one or more {{agent}}s in {{fleet}}. The enrollment token enrolls the {{agent}} in a specific agent policy that defines the data to be collected by the agent and which output to use. You can use the token as many times as needed. It will remain valid until you revoke it.

The enrollment token is used for the initial communication between {{agent}} and {{fleet-server}}. After the initial connection request from {{agent}}, {{fleet-server}} passes a communication API key to the agent. This API key includes only the necessary permissions to communicate with {{fleet-server}}. If the API key is invalid, {{fleet-server}} stops communicating with {{agent}}.

Depending on the output of the agent policy with which the enrollment token is associated, {{fleet-server}} also passes additional data to {{agent}}:
    
* For the {{es}} and remote {{es}} outputs, it passes an output API key.
    
    This API key is used to send data to {{es}}. It has the minimal permissions needed to ingest all the data specified by the agent policy. If the API key is invalid, {{agent}} stops ingesting data into {{es}}.

* For the Kafka output, it passes authentication parameters.

    The authentication parameters are defined in the authentication settings of the Kafka output and are used by {{agent}} to authenticate with the Kafka cluster before sending data to it.

* For the {{ls}} output, it passes SSL/TLS configuration details.

    The SSL/TLS configuration details such as the SSL certificate authority, the SSL certificate, and the SSL certificate key are defined during {{ls}} output creation. {{agent}} uses SSL/TLS client authentication to authenticate with the {{ls}} pipeline before sending data to it.

:::{note}
Although an API key is generated during {{ls}} output creation, this key is not passed to {{agent}} by {{fleet-server}}. If the {{ls}} pipeline uses the {{es}} output, this API key is used by {{ls}} to authenticate with the {{es}} cluster before sending data to it.

## Create enrollment tokens [create-fleet-enrollment-tokens]

Create enrollment tokens and use them to enroll {{agent}}s in specific policies.

::::{tip}
When you use the {{fleet}} UI to add an agent or create a new policy, {{fleet}} creates an enrollment token for you automatically.
::::


To create an enrollment token:

1. In {{kib}}, go to **Management → {{fleet}} → Enrollment tokens**.
2. Click  **Create enrollment token**. Name your token and select an agent policy.

    Note that the token name you specify must be unique so as to avoid conflict with any existing API keys.

3. Click **Create enrollment token**.
4. In the list of tokens, click the **Show token** icon to see the token secret.

All {{agent}}s enrolled through this token will use the selected policy unless you assign or enroll them in a different policy.

To learn how to install {{agent}}s and enroll them in {{fleet}}, refer to [*Install {{agent}}s*](/reference/fleet/install-elastic-agents.md).

::::{tip}
You can use the {{fleet}} API to get a list of enrollment tokens. For more information, refer to [{{kib}} {{fleet}} APIs](/reference/fleet/fleet-api-docs.md).

## Revoke enrollment tokens [revoke-fleet-enrollment-tokens]

You can revoke an enrollment token that you no longer wish to use to enroll {{agents}} in an agent policy in {{fleet}}. Revoking an enrollment token essentially invalidates the API key used by agents to communicate with {{fleet-server}}.

To revoke an enrollment token:

1. In {{fleet}}, click **Enrollment tokens**.
2. Find the token you want to revoke in the list and click the **Revoke token** icon.

    :::{image} images/revoke-token.png
    :alt: Enrollment tokens tab with Revoke token highlighted
    :screenshot:
    :::

3. Click **Revoke enrollment token**. You can no longer use this token to enroll {{agent}}s. However, the currently enrolled agents will continue to function.

    To re-enroll your {{agent}}s, use an active enrollment token.


Note that when an enrollment token is revoked it is not immediately deleted. Deletion occurs automatically after the duration specified in the {{es}} [`xpack.security.authc.api_key.delete.retention_period`](elasticsearch://reference/elasticsearch/configuration-reference/security-settings.md#api-key-service-settings-delete-retention-period) setting has expired (see [Invalidate API key API](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-security-invalidate-api-key) for details).

Until the enrollment token has been deleted:

* The token name may not be re-used when you [create an enrollment token](#create-fleet-enrollment-tokens).
* The token continues to be visible in the {{fleet}} UI.
* The token continues to be returned by a `GET /api/fleet/enrollment_api_keys` API request. Revoked enrollment tokens are identified as `"active": false`.
