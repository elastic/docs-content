# Elastic Common Schema

Elastic Common Schema (ECS) defines a common set of fields for ingesting data into Elasticsearch.
For field details and usage information, refer to [](ecs://docs/reference/index.md).

ECS loggers are plugins for your favorite logging libraries, which help you to format your logs into ECS-compatible JSON. Check out [](ecs-logging://docs/reference/intro.md).
