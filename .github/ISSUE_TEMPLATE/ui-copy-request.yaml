      description: When would it be ideal for for us to complete the request? What deliverables do you need, and when? If applicable, how do the release timelines for this feature differ between serverless / stateful? 
      placeholder: |
        For example:

        We need a final draft of the new UI copy no later than December 5, ideally by December 1. No differences between serverless/ESS. 

        This is an urgent request, it would be great to have updated copy for A and B ASAP, since the original copy is already in production. No differences between serverless/ESS.
