# Elastic {{observability}} deprecations [elastic-observability-deprecations]
Over time, certain Elastic functionality becomes outdated and is replaced or removed. To help with the transition, Elastic deprecates functionality for a period before removal, giving you time to update your applications. 

Review the deprecated functionality for Elastic {{observability}}. While deprecations have no immediate impact, we strongly encourage you update your implementation after you upgrade. To learn how to upgrade, check out [Upgrade](/deploy-manage/upgrade.md).
