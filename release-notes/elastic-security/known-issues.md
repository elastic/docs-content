:::{dropdown} The {{elastic-agent}} Docker image is not available at `docker.elastic.co/beats/elastic-agent:9.0.0`

Applies to: 9.0.0

**Impact**

The {{elastic-agent}} image is not available from `docker.elastic.co/beats/elastic-agent:9.0.0`. The default manifests for integrations that run {{elastic-agent}} on Kubernetes—such as CSPM or CNVM—use this image location, resulting in an error.

**Workaround**

Instead of trying to pull the image from `docker.elastic.co/beats/elastic-agent:9.0.0`, edit the manifests to pull it from `docker.elastic.co/elastic-agent/elastic-agent:9.0.0`.

:::{dropdown} Elastic Defend's Network driver may lead to bug checks

**Applies to: {{agent}} 8.17.8, 8.18.3, and 9.0.3**

On July 8, 2025, a known issue was discovered in Elastic Defend's network driver that may lead to kernel pool corruption, resulting in bug checks (BSODs) on Windows systems with a large number of long-lived network connections that remain inactive for 30+ minutes.

The system may bug check with any of a variety of codes such as `SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION` or `PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA`.

For more information, check [elastic/endpoint#90](https://github.com/elastic/endpoint/issues/90).

**Workaround**

If you're on 9.0.3, upgrade to the fixed version: [9.0.3+build202507110136](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/elastic-agent-9-0-3+build202507110136).

If you're on 8.18.3, upgrade to the fixed version: [8.18.3+build202507101319](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/elastic-agent-8-18-3+build202507101319).

If you're on 8.17.8, downgrade to 8.17.7 or install 8.17.9 once it becomes available.

If you're unable to upgrade or downgrade, set `advanced.kernel.network: false` in your Defend advanced policy.

:::{dropdown} Security AI Assistant Knowledge Base settings UI not displaying

Applies to: 9.0.3

On June 24, 2025, an error was discovered that prevents the AI Assistant Knowledge Base settings UI from displaying, including the **Setup Knowledge Base** button and alert configuration options. As a result, the Knowledge Base cannot be set up or configured through the Knowledge Base settings UI.

**Workaround**

While the UI for configuring the Knowledge Base is blocked, you can still enable it
[from an AI Assistant conversation](/solutions/security/ai/ai-assistant-knowledge-base.md#_option_1_enable_knowledge_base_from_an_ai_assistant_conversation).

After enabling the Knowledge Base, you can manage entries using the AI Assistant API:

* List Knowledge Base entries using the [find knowledge base entry API]({{kib-apis}}/operation/operation-findknowledgebaseentries):

  ```console
  GET /api/security_ai_assistant/knowledge_base/entries/_find?page=1&per_page=100
  ```

* Create a Knowledge Base index entry using the [create knowledge base entry API]({{kib-apis}}/operation/operation-createknowledgebaseentry):

  ```console
  POST /api/security_ai_assistant/knowledge_base/entries
  {
    "type": "index",
    "name": "test",
    "index": "test-index",
    "field": "mock",
    "outputFields": ["example"],
    "description": "test description",
    "queryDescription": "test query description"
  }
  ```

* Create a Knowledge Base document entry using the [create knowledge base entry API]({{kib-apis}}/operation/operation-createknowledgebaseentry):

  ```console
  POST /api/security_ai_assistant/knowledge_base/entries
  {
    "type": "document",
    "kbResource": "user",
    "source": "user",
    "name": "doc"
  }
  ```

:::{dropdown} The entity risk score feature may stop persisting risk score documents

Applies to: {{stack}} 9.0.0, 9.0.1, 9.0.2

On May 30, 2025, it was discovered that the entity risk score feature may stop persisting risk score documents if risk scoring was turned on before you upgraded to {{stack}} 8.18.0+ or 9.0.0+. This is due to a bug that prevents the `entity_analytics_create_eventIngest_from_timestamp-pipeline-<space_name>` ingest pipeline (which is set as a default pipeline for the risk scoring index in {{stack}} 8.18.0) from being created when {{kib}} starts up.

While document persistence may initially succeed, it will eventually fail after 0 to 30 days. This is how long it takes for the risk score data stream to roll over and apply its underlying index settings to the new default pipeline.

**NOTE:** This bug does not affect {{es}} clusters created in {{stack}} 8.18.0 or 9.0.0 and higher. It also won't affect you if you only turned on entity risk scoring in {{stack}} 8.18.0 or 9.0.0 and higher.

**Workaround**

To resolve this issue, apply the following workaround before or after upgrading to {{stack}} 9.0.0 or higher.

First, manually create the ingest pipeline in each space that has entity risk scoring turned on. You can do this using a PUT request, which is described in the example below. When reviewing the example, note that `default` in the example ingest pipeline name below is the {{kib}} space ID.

```
PUT /_ingest/pipeline/entity_analytics_create_eventIngest_from_timestamp-pipeline-default
{
  "_meta": {
    "managed_by": "entity_analytics",
    "managed": true
  },
  "description": "Pipeline for adding timestamp value to event.ingested",
  "processors": [
    {
      "set": {
        "field": "event.ingested",
        "value": "{{_ingest.timestamp}}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

After you complete this step, risk scores should automatically begin to successfully persist during the entity risk engine's next run. Details for the next run time are described on the **Entity risk score** page, where you can also manually run the risk score by clicking **Run Engine**.

:::{dropdown} Installing an {{elastic-defend}} integration or a new agent policy upgrades installed prebuilt rules, reverting user customizations and overwriting user-added actions and exceptions

Applies to: {{stack}} 9.0.0

On April 10, 2025, it was discovered that when you install a new {{elastic-defend}} integration or agent policy, the installed prebuilt detection rules upgrade to their latest versions (if any new versions are available). The upgraded rules lose any user-added rule actions, exceptions, and customizations.

**Workaround**

To resolve this issue, before you add an {{elastic-defend}} integration to a policy in {{fleet}}, apply any pending prebuilt rule updates. This will prevent rule actions, exceptions, and customizations from being overwritten.

:::{dropdown} The technical preview badge incorrectly displays on the alert suppression fields for event correlation rules

Applies to: {{stack}} 9.0.0 and 9.0.1

On April 8, 2025, it was discovered that alert suppression for event correlation rules is incorrectly shown as being in technical preview when you create a new rule. For more information, check [#1021](https://github.com/elastic/docs-content/issues/1021).

:::{dropdown} Interaction between Elastic Defend and Trellix Access Protection causes IRQL_NOT_LESS_EQUAL bugcheck

Applies to: {{elastic-defend}} 9.0.0

An `IRQL_NOT_LESS_EQUAL` [bugcheck](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/bug-checks--blue-screens-) in the {{elastic-defend}} driver happens due to an interaction with Trellix Access Protection (`mfehidk.sys`). This issue can occur when `elastic-endpoint-driver.sys` calls [`FwpmTransactionBegin0`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fwpmu/nf-fwpmu-fwpmtransactionbegin0) to initialize its network driver. `FwpmTransactionBegin0` performs a synchronous RPC call to the user-mode Base Filtering Engine service. Trellix's driver intercepts this service's operations, causing `FwpmTransactionBegin0` to hang or slow significantly. This delay prevents {{elastic-defend}} driver from properly initializing in a timely manner. Subsequent system activity can invoke {{elastic-defend}}'s driver before it has fully initialized, leading to a `IRQL_NOT_LESS_EQUAL` bugcheck. This issue affects {{elastic-defend}} versions 8.16.0-8.16.6, 8.17.0-8.17.5, 8.18.0, and 9.0.0.

**Workaround**<br>

If you can't upgrade, either disable Trellix Access Protection or add a [Trellix Access Protection exclusion](https://docs.trellix.com/bundle/endpoint-security-10.6.0-threat-prevention-client-interface-reference-guide-windows/page/GUID-6AC245A1-5E5D-4BAF-93B0-FE7FD33571E6.html) for the Base Filtering Engine service (`C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe`).

:::{dropdown} Unbounded kernel non-paged memory growth issue in Elastic Defend's kernal driver causes slow down on Windows systems

Applies to: {{elastic-defend}} 9.0.0

An unbounded kernel non-paged memory growth issue in {{elastic-defend}}'s kernel driver occurs during extremely high event load situations on Windows. Systems affected by this issue will slow down or become unresponsive until the triggering event load (for example, network activity) subsides. We are only aware of this issue occurring on very busy Windows Server systems running {{elastic-defend}} versions 8.16.0-8.16.6, 8.17.0-8.17.5, 8.18.0, and 9.0.0

**Workaround**<br>

If you can't upgrade, turn off the relevant event source at the kernel level using your {{elastic-defend}} [advanced policy settings (optional)](/solutions/security/configure-elastic-defend/configure-an-integration-policy-for-elastic-defend.md#adv-policy-settings):

* Network Events - Set the `windows.advanced.kernel.network` advanced setting to `false`.
* Registry Events - Set the `windows.advanced.kernel.registry` advanced setting to `false`.

Note that clearing the corresponding checkbox under [event collection](/solutions/security/configure-elastic-defend/configure-an-integration-policy-for-elastic-defend.md#event-collection) is insufficient, as {{elastic-defend}} may still process these event sources internally to support other features.
