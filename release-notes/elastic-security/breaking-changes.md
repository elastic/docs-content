* `POST /api/detection_engine/rules/_bulk_create` has been replaced by `POST /api/detection_engine/rules/_import`
* `PUT /api/detection_engine/rules/_bulk_update` has been replaced by `POST /api/detection_engine/rules/_bulk_action`
* `PATCH /api/detection_engine/rules/_bulk_update has been replaced by `POST /api/detection_engine/rules/_bulk_action`
* `DELETE /api/detection_engine/rules/_bulk_delete` has been replaced by `POST /api/detection_engine/rules/_bulk_action`
* `POST api/detection_engine/rules/_bulk_delete` has been replaced by `POST /api/detection_engine/rules/_bulk_action`

These changes were introduced in [#197422]({{kib-pull}}197422).

**Impact**<br> Deprecated endpoints will fail with a 404 status code starting from version 9.0.0.

**Action**<br>

Update your implementations to use the new endpoints:

* **For bulk creation of rules:**

    * Use `POST /api/detection_engine/rules/_import` ([API documentation](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/kibana/operation/operation-importrules)) to create multiple rules along with their associated entities (for example, exceptions and action connectors).
    * Alternatively, create rules individually using `POST /api/detection_engine/rules` ([API documentation](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/kibana/operation/operation-createrule)).

* **For bulk updates of rules:**

    * Use `POST /api/detection_engine/rules/_bulk_action` ([API documentation](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/kibana/operation/operation-performrulesbulkaction)) to update fields in multiple rules simultaneously.
    * Alternatively, update rules individually using `PUT /api/detection_engine/rules` ([API documentation](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/kibana/operation/operation-updaterule)).

* **For bulk deletion of rules:**

    * Use `POST /api/detection_engine/rules/_bulk_action` ([API documentation](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/kibana/operation/operation-performrulesbulkaction)) to delete multiple rules by IDs or query.
    * Alternatively, delete rules individually using `DELETE /api/detection_engine/rules` ([API documentation](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/kibana/operation/operation-deleterule)).
